<Brief history>
Please refer to admission note.

<SICU course>
After admission to SICU on 5/13 night, massive bloody stool was noted and
emergent CTA showed ascending to transverse colon junction extravasation,
so TAE was performed over SMA distal branch. However, another episode of
massive bloody stool developed on 5/14 morning even though Pitressin used,
so TAE was performed again. On 5/15 morning, another episode of bloody
stool developed and TAE didn't find active bleeding area. After consulting
with GI and GS specialist, we gave somatosan first.
  Cardiac echo on 5/18 showed fair EF. We contacted GI man and they
suggested colonoscope was not neccessary. Since there was no more bloody
stool, we tried NG D5W with glutamine on 5/18 and milk on 5/19. We
discontinued somatostatin. He had fair stool passage on 5/22 under
prokinetics. We tried off ECMO gas flow on 5/18 but hypotention was noted.
He had fever and we did septic workup. VA-ECMO was shifted to VV-ECMO and
CVC was changed on 5/19. S/C yeild MDRAB and sphingomonas pauimobilis and
we shifted abx to Cravit. Tracheostomy was done on 5/20. He had
intermittent fever with chillness and we repeated culture. ECMO temporature
was adjusted to 37.5C. We started heparin use on 5/22. He had fluctuated
BP, so we adjusted sedation medication and gave volume support accordingly.
  We added Solumedrol according to low procalcitonin level(0.2407) on 5/25.
However, one episode of HR and BP drop with spontaneous recover. We added
levophed and redo fever workup. We added Mepem for S/C MDRAB, pseudomonas
and shift to Maxipime on 5/27 according to sensitivity. ECMO wound culture
yielded pseudomonas and chillness with fever persisted, so we escalated to
Collistin on 5/29 and added Gentamicin on 5/30. Now, still low grade fever
noted. Tracheostomy wound oozing and coffee graound from NG developed on
5/30 and transamine use + Bosmin inhalation accordingly.
  We performed bedside electrocauterization for tracheostomy wound oozing.
We tried to taper off VV-ECMO gas flow on 6/1, but his SpO2 level dropped
down to below 90% when changing position. Thus we resumed VV-ECMO gas flow,
and ECMO circuit was changed on 6/3 with heparin use due to much blood clot
noted in the old circuit. We started to taper sedatives since 6/4, but
patient agitated on 6/6 after Dormicum off. SBP up to 200mmHg was noted,
and hematemesis and bloody stool were noted. As a result we discontinued
heparin and added back Dormicum. We also added Petressin, Nexium,
Somatosan, and Perdipine, and component therapy was administered. Oral
medication was all discontinued.
