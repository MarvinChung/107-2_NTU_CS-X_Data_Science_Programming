3. Hypertension

Treatment Course 3/10-3/14
     The patient was admitted to 3C1 on 3/10 due to massive esophageal
variceal bleeding during EGD exam. He was intubated for airway protection
After admission, aggressive component therapy was given along with DLC and
CVC insertion. SB tube was inserted as GI doctor suggested on 3/10-3/12 and
somatostatin infusion pump and and high dose PPI were given as well to
control GI bleeding.
     TPN with potassiu-free was administered for nutrition support given
NPO status. His urine output decreased gradually with worsened renal
function.Paracentesis 1500ml cloudy orange ascites was performed for
abdominal distention relief and for suspected abdominal compartment
syndrome related AKI. Oral candidiasis was noticed so fluconazole 100mg IV
was given.
     2rd EGD exam on 3/12 showed esophageal varices without active bleeding
and much bloody clot in stomach. No intervention was done. SB tube was
removed as GI doctor suggested. The patient could not sleep and became mild
delirious at night, which may represent Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy.
     3rd EGD exam on 3/13 afternoon was performed. It revealed
esophageal varices F2Cb with red color signs without active bleeding were
noted. Multiple scars and erosive mucosa were noted. EV ligation x3 with
Super 7 were performed. the forth and fifth ligation failed. Spurting
vessel was noted at failed ligation site. GI doctor suggested SB tube
tamponade again since 3/13 for high risk of re-bleeding. They adviced to
consult GS to assess indication for surgical devascularization due to
technically demanding lesions. The patient became more drowsy and confused
after EGD exam on 3/13 and follow up serum ammonium level was high. Tazocin
was given in place of ceftazidime for progressive VAP.

Plan:
1. NPO with TPN(K-free) support
2. Record SB tube blood amount w/ component therapy
   Keep PPI and somatostatin
3. Keep Ceftazidime for SBP and VAP
4. Give rasitol 20mg Q12H with titration
5. GI 胡勝堯: difficult EVL in this patient. Suggest keep SB
   tube tamponade and medical Tx. Consult GS for
   devascularization
   GS 黃凱文 : He is abroad now and will return toTaiwan on
              3/15.
   Consult him after he returns
   Radiologist 梁博欽: He need to see the image before
   performing TVE but he is not in Taipei now. He will reveiw
   the image tomorrow
6. Upgrade ceftazidime to Tazocin
