Brief Summary of this week
After first cycle of modified FOLFOX, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were
noted. After giving G-CSF for 3 days from 2/5 to 2/7, white count and
platelet count increased. Follow-up hemogram, T-Bil and Cre level were
acceptable, so the second cycle of modidfied FOLFOX was started on
2015/02/11. Marked abdominal distention was noted and bedside echo showed
distended bowel and moderate amount of ascites. Paracentesis was performed
on 2015/02/13 and totally 1360 ml clear yellowish ascites was drained out.
