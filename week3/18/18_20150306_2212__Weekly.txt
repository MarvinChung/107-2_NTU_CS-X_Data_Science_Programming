Brief Summary of this week
<Treatment Course>
  After admission, elevated serum creatinine was not noted at admission.
Restaging (brain + chest + abdomen + pelvis) CT revealed enlarged HCC with
new lesions at the adrenal glands, para-aortic lymph nodes, and lungs,
along with pulmonary embolism. As a result, progressive disease was
impressed. mFOLFOX was administered from 1/28-1/30, without significant
complications. Clexane was administered at a dosage of 1amp BID, but was
held on 1/29 due to the presence of gum bleeding and epistaxis. Melana was
noted at noon on 1/30. Panendoscopy was arranged on 1/31 which showed
esophageal varices, F3Cb with red-colored sign; 3 gastric ulcers, A2,
antrum; gastric varices over the fundus. IV PPI and NPO were then ordered.
No more melena was found and the patient started oral intake and PPI was
shifted to oral form.
  After first cycle of modified FOLFOX, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia
were noted. After giving G-CSF for 3 days from 2/5 to 2/7, white count and
platelet count increased. Follow-up hemogram, T-Bil and Cre level were
acceptable, so the second cycle of modidfied FOLFOX was started on
2015/02/11 with decreased oxaliplatin dose (60 mg/m^2). TPN support was
also given due to poor oral intake. Follow-up hemogram did not showed
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia this time. Paracentesis was performed on
2/13 and 2/16, totally 1360 ml and 790 ml clear yellowish ascites were
drained out respectively.
  Urinary retention was noted on 2/15 and Foley catheter was inserted.
However, progressive symmetrical swelling of bilateral acrotum was noted.
We consulted urologists and scrotal echo was done on 2/25, which showed
bilateral hydrocele and soft tissue edema over scrotal skin. Leg elevation
and treat underlying ascites were suggested. We gave cash albumin
supplement and increased diuretics dose. Paracentesis of 1700 ml
serosanginous ascites was performed again on 2/24, and the hydrocele
partially improved.

  The 3rd cycle of FOLFOX was given on 2/25 with oxaliplatin dose back to
70 mg/m^2. Persisted hyponatremia was noted and hypervolemic hyponatremia
was impressed, so Clinimix 1500 ml was shifted to Nutriflex 1000 ml on 2/25
for free water restriction. Foley catheter was removed on 2/27 and self-
voiding was achieved.
   Due to progressive abdominal fullness and hydrocele, TPN was stopped on
3/2. NG tube feeding was tried since 3/2. Paracentesis with 1520ml ascites
was done on 3/3. Sleepy appearance was noted. His NH3 level was 65.
Lactulose was added up. His conscious level recovered smoothly. The
abdominal fullness and hydrocele improved a lot. However, the ascites
analysis revealed SBP. Ceftazidime was given since 3/3. Low grade fever
improved then. We would keep on current supportive care.
