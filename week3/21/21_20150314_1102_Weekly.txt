Brief Summary of this week
After admission, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and Tamiflu were continued. The
patient was still in comatous status with GCS: E1M1Vt. Bilateral pupils
were both small (2 ~ 2.5 mm) with trace light reflex. Diuretics were added
to keep I/O negative, which made pulmonary edema and pitting edema
gradually improved. Depakine was added for seizure prophylaxis but
intermittent focal seizure presenting as left mouth angle twitching was
still noted. EEG was done on 3/9 and showed severe diffuse cortical
dysfunction, which was compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy.

[FEMH]
3/5 Brain CT at FEMH: no ICH nor large ischemic stroke, r/o hypoxic-
ischemic encephalopathy.
3/6 Intermittent focal seizure attacks presenting as mouth angle twitching,
gave Depakine and Anxicam infusion.
3/6 EGD: DU and GERD grade D. Removal of foreign body (tooth) in the
esophagus.

Plan
1. DC Rocephin after completing 10-day treatment course
2. Keep Rivotril and Keppra and monitor seizure control
3. DC all diuretics
   Monitor renal function and keep electrolytes balance
   Inform families the possibility of hemodialysis
4. Pursue EEG report
5. Insulin for glycemic control
