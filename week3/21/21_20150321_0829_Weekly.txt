Brief Summary of this week
Repeated EEG on 3/13 also showed no background activity, compatible with
hypoxic encephalopathy. Ceftriaxone was discontinued on 3/14 after 10-day
treatment course. Cluster respiratory pattern was noted under PC/SIMV + PS
mode, and the tidal volume was less than 300 ml. Therefore, ventilator mode
was shifted to PC/AC mode on 3/21 for better support.

[Important consultations and family's decision]
3/11 Neurologists
  1. Increase Keppra to 750mg BID

  3. Follow up EEG in one week later
3/18 Families prefer to hold family meeting next week

[Important intervention and new added medications]

3/5-3/9 Tamiflu

3/10-3/11 Phenytoin
3/11- Keppra + Rivotril

3/9- Norvasc  3/15- QD => BID
3/10- Dilatrend

[FEMH]
3/5 Brain CT at FEMH: no ICH nor large ischemic stroke, r/o hypoxic-
ischemic encephalopathy.
3/6 Intermittent focal seizure attacks presenting as mouth angle twitching,
gave Depakine and Anxicam infusion.
3/6 EGD: DU and GERD grade D. Removal of foreign body (tooth) in the
esophagus.
Echocardiography: LV global hypokinesia, LVEF (37%)


Plan
1. Abx free, monitor BT curve
2. Keep Rivotril and Keppra and monitor seizure control
3. Monitor renal function and keep electrolytes balance
4. Arrange family meeting next W2 for further longterm care plan
