*照會需求: 諮詢末期判定
(家屬想了解目前病人情況是否符合醫療上認定末期可撤除呼吸器的階段)
*DNR(+,同意書,除插管呼吸器), consiousness E1M1Vt, cough reflex(-)
*Importance lab and image:
3/23 WBC 7570 Hb 9.0 plt 338k BUN 90.1 Cre 2.7 Na 142 K 4.7
3/13 EEG: no discernible cortical activities, compatible with hypoxic
encephalopathy
3/18 Brain CT: loss of gray-white matter differentiation due to loss of
autoregulation
*病人不知病末, 家屬知病知末
*Key person: 家人共同決定; main caregiver: ICU team

*Suggestion:
1. According to poor consiousness with blank EEG, the patient may be deemed
as vegetative state, but not equal to terminal status.
2. May contact neurologist for confirmation test of brainstem death.
3. I have explained to family that terminal status could not be defined now
due to the fact of brainstem death is not sure.
4. 請協助在portal上標註DNR狀態. 末期判定兩位專科醫師中,
需要至少一位相關專科醫師--神經專科或神經外科專科醫師.
5. We will follow this patient via combined care.
6. Thanks for consultation. Contact 63274東址共照辦公室 for further
questions.
