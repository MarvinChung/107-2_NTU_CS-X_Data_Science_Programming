主訴(Chief Complaint) 
Informant: patient's son
bradycardia with dizziness found at around 16:00 and sudden collapse at 21:50 on 2016/6/14 
病史(Brief History) 
【Present Illness】
This is an 86-year-old female with the medical history of
1. Coronary artery disease, triple vessel disease, status post percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty with stenting to left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, with insignificant in-stent re-stenosis of left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery, and PD-PL bification to PLA proximal 70% stenosis of right coronary artery, status post percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty with stenting to right coronary artery on 2011/10/4
2. End stage renal disease, under maintenance hemodialysis on QW2,4,6 (2015/3/24-)
3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
4. Congestive heart failure NYHA functional class III
5. Diabetes mellitus, type 2, with nephropathy
6. Hypertension
7. Dyslipidemia
8. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease
9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
11. Old cerebrovascular disease

The patient received regular follow at CV and nephrology OPD in NTUH for years. Her drug compliance was good and her daily activity of life is dependent. She sometimes suffered from intermittent chest tightness while exertion. This time, she received maintenance hemodialysis at local clinic as usual in the morning on 2016/6/14. However, she suffered from dizziness at home at around 16:00. She did not feel chest pain, radiation back pain or cold sweating. His son found that her heart rate was irregular and the rate was around 42/min. Her blood pressure was around 140/70mmHg and the one touch sugar was around 200 mg/dl. She took a rest and took dinner as usual. 

However, she suffered from sudden collapse at around 21:50 on 2016/6/14. Her son called EMT and he started chest compression at around 21:50. According to the EMT record, total 10 minutes of chest compression and one DC shock were performed. She was brought to the emergency department of NTUH. Endotracheal intubation was performed. Chest compression was given for 2 minutes at NTUH. Return to spontaneous circulation was recorded at 22:03. The ECG showed suspected atrio-ventricular block. Premix dopamine was given for bradycardia. Her consciousness recovered to baseline in the emergency department. The patient did not have fever or choking, vomiting before the episode. Empirical Ceftriaxone was prescribed. The brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Under the impression of out-of-hospital cardial arrest, suspected atrioventricular block, sick-sinus syndrome, she was transferred to CCU for further management.

   2016/6/14 Cardiac echo (preliminary)
   LVEDD/ESD: 46/28mm, LVEF: 69.7%, LA: 43mm
   dilated LA. mild MR, mild mAR, mild PR
   mild-to-moderate TR
   moderate pulmonary HTn (TRmaxPG: 45.2 mmHg)

   2015/9/1  24hr Holter
   1. Basically sinus rhythm, HR 54 ~ 110 bpm, average 76 bpm.
   2. Occasional ventricular ectopies (177 beats, 0.2%) with 169 single PVCs.
   3. Occasional supraventricular ectopies (57 beats, 0.1%) with 2 atrial
      runs (longest 8 beats, fastest 130 bpm), 5 atrial pairs, 36 single PACs.
   4. No long pause.
   5. No significant ST-T change

Impression
1. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, suspect atrioventricular block or sick-sinus syndrome related, status post cardiopulmonary resusitation for about 12 minutes, with return to spontaneous circulation, status post endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (2016/6/14)
2. Coronary artery disease, triple vessel disease, status post percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty with stenting to left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, with insignificant in-stent re-stenosis of left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery, and PD-PL bification to PLA proximal 70% stenosis of right coronary artery, status post percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty with stenting to right coronary artery on 2011/10/4
3. End stage renal disease, under maintenance hemodialysis on QW2,4,6 (2015/3/24-)
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
5. Congestive heart failure NYHA functional class III
6. Diabetes mellitus, type 2, with nephropathy
7. Hypertension
8. Dyslipidemia
9. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease
10. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
11. Old cerebrovascular disease

Plans
1. On temporatory pacemaker for AV block
   Discontinue Amiodarone first and also check thyroid
   function. Correct electrolyte imbalance
   Arrange EP study first
   Discuss with CV Dr Lin about further managment
2. Keep maintainence hemodialysis. Inform the family to 
   bring the dialysis summary at local clinic
3. Empirical Ceftiaxone. Complete septic workup
4. No need for hypothermia since consciousness recovered 
   at ED
5. Give IV PPI and keep NPO with IVF due to NG coffee-
   ground (suspect ET-tube related). 
   Keep Plavix and hold Aspirin due to UGI bleeding
   Consider resume feeding
6. Control blood sugar and blood pressure
7. Taper the ventilator gradually. Try CPAP/PS

Treatment Goal:
1. Find out the etiology of bradycardia
2. Extubation
3. Control BP. SBP<150mmHg 
4. Avoid intradialytic hypotension
