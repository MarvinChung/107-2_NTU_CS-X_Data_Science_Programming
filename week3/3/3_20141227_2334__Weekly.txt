Brief Summary of this week
After admission, CVVH was started to correct metabolic acidosis causing
profound shock. An episode of Torsade de points with QTc prolongation was
found, resolved following correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
Consulted psychiatrist for suspected neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(progressive elevation of CPK level and tremor of limb) suggested Lorazepam
use, while NMS was less likely (no hyperthermia, no rigidity of limb), but
atypical presentation has been reported with Clozapine use. Drug screening
were negative.

On 12/22 midnight, sudden rapid progressive desaturation developed, and she
remained hypoxic despite high PEEP (16) and FiO2 (100%). Resuscitation was
initiated when PEA ensued. Bedside echo showed no evidence of pneumothorax
and small amount of pleural effusion. CXR showed butterfly distributation
opacity, consistent with picture of pulmonary edema. There was plenty of
pink fronthy sputum aspirated from ET tube. CVS was consulted where VA ECMO
was successfully inserted following CPCR for more than 60 minutes.
Inhalation NO was started for profound hypoxia. Post-resuscitation
echocardiography showed LVEF 55.7ï¼Ÿ000 0000 mild MR, PR, TR and mild
pulmonary hypertension (TRPH 32mmHg). Polyuria (Urine amount>5L) developed
after then where urine osmolarity was low (93), suggestive of diabetes
insipidus. Oligouria ensued, following 2mcg of DDAVP.

She remained comatous with no spontaneous breathing after resuscitation. As
hemodynamic stabilized, ECMO was removed on 12/25, with subsequent weaning
of CVVH. O2 demand increased after weaning of ECMO and acute kidney injury
developed. Empiric Cravit was replaced with Mepem, Targocid and Diflucan on
12/27 because of concern of sepsis (hypothermia, poor oxygenation,
fluctuated BP, elevated CRP). Bedside echo showed LLL consolidation and
moderate amount of right pleural effusion.

12/21 Off Pitressin in the morning

          Progressive elevation of CPK level and tremor of limb
          Consult psychiatrist for suspected NMS
-> consult psychiatrist: suggest ativan 2# TID PO, titrate according to CK.
    NMS less likely (no rigidity, no hyperthermia), but atypical
presentation with Clozapine has been reported
-> May discuss use of Bromocriptine and Dantrolene with neurologist

       Family decided no reon ECMO even indicated.
       Weaning CVVH at 7 PM.
12/26 Desautration and elevated O2 demand to FiO2 55->80% at AM,
          especially at right side. --> Taper to 55% at evening.
          Neurologist: prefer contrast brain MRI if no contraindication
          VS: check including brain stem
          ID: if still fever, change cravit to Maxipime
          No coffee-ground. Try D5Wr 50ml Q6H
12/27 Acute kidney injury Cre 0.9-> 1.4
          Hypothermia, worsened oxygenation
          Bedside echo: LLL consolidation, moderate pleural effusion at Rt

Plan
1. Repeat septic work up, escalate antibiotic to broad spectrum Mepem,
Diflucan and Targocid, pursue culture work up
2. NG feeding (high proteit diet, Alb 2.2)
3. Albumin supplement, judicious hydration, monitor renal function and
urine amount
4. Explain poor prognosis, high possibility of hypoxic encephalopathy and
remained vegetative in the future. Patient's father signed DNR consent
5. Arrange brain MRI (including brain stem) when hemodynamic stabilized
6. Best supportive care (DNR except medication, including ECMO)
