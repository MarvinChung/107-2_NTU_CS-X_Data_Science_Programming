Brief Summary of this week
Three sets of blood culture reported Stenotrophomona maltophilia. We
changed Mepem to Cravit according to drug sensitivity test report. Clinical
condition stablized with no more lactic acidosis. But dialysis flow from AV
shunt was insuffient on 2015/07/20. We had discussed with the family about
further hemodialysis, and they insisted in regular hemodialysis according
to alertness and awareness of the patient. Therefore, we inserted one
double lumen at right femoral area at hemodialysis room, and dialysis flow
was sufficient. But he reported right lower abdomen pain without obvious
tenderness, muscle guarding, rebounding pain, abscent bowel sound or free
air on plain film. Once intravenous morphine was provided and symptom was
releived immediately. Hemodialysis on the next day was smooth. Regular
followed lab data showed progressively hyperbilirubinemia, but no obvious
detoriation in serum albumin or coagulopathy.
