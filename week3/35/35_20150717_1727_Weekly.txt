Brief Summary of this week
After transfered to general ward, we maintained regular hemodialysis 3
times a week and kept dpamine infusion. Follow-up lab data showed CRP still
elevated, and thus we continue the use of Tazocin.  Aggrassive laxative was
applied for maldigestion, constipation, abdomen distension, and delirium.
Although there was transient improvement, the bowel movement deteriorated
soon in the night on 2015/07/13. Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.397, HCO3 14.1
mEq/L) in the morning on July 14 and hypotension developed during
hemodialysis. Thus we titrated up the dosage of dopamine and provided
NaHCO3 infusion. Severe lactic acidosis (11.7 mg/dL), leukocytosis (WBC
15250/cmm, segment 90%), and elvation of CRP (13.4 mg/dL) were reported at
10:40. We then changed antibiotics from Tazocin to Tienam and Vancomycin
for sepsis. Post-hemodialysis gas analysis showed persistive metabolic
acidosis despite Rolikan supplement. His sons signed "DO NOT
RESCUCITATION", declined hemodialysis and central venous catheter
insertion. Chest, abdomen and pelvis CT with/without contrast revealed
nutmeg liver, bilateral pleural effusion, and emphysematous gastritis. NG
tube with compression was applied for abdomen pain.
Follow-up data on 2015/07/15 morning revealed persistent lactic acidosis
and hyperbilirubinemia. The family members have diversed opinion and
withdrew the consent of no hemodialysis and medication. We then resumed
hemodialysis on July 15. Meanwhile, lactic acidosis resolved gradually.
Blood culture collected from central venous line on July 14 were reported
to have gram negative bacteria. His conscious remained disoriented and his
biological clock reversed. The systolic blood pressure was about 90-110mmHg
under Dopamine support.
Currently, he receives hemodialysis every other day and TPN for prolonged
fasting.

    => discontinue Vancomycin; add TPN 1000c.c
     Owing to hemodynamic stablization and improving clinical condition, we
keep Tienam.


Plan
1. Arrange hemodialysis on July 18
2. Regular check lab data daily
3. Do blood culture at HD room
4. Start TPN support today
5. Keep NPO until hemodynamic stablization
6. Pursue blood culture sensitivity report for further antibiotics
adjustment
