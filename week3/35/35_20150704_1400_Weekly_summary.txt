The 66-year-old had current problems:
1. Septic shock, with metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, resolving
2. GI bleeding from NG, resulting in hyperammonemia and encephalopathy
3. Hypercalcemia, caused?
4. Atrial fibrillation, presistent, status post Digoxin 0.125mg
loading

[History]
1. Coronary artery disease, 3-vessle disease, s/p:
   CABG in 2004/01
   NSTEMI in 2011/01, 2014/10
   CPR with IABP support in 2014/10-11
2. mitral regurgitation, Carpentier's IIIb, (restriction of PML)
3. End stage kidney disease, status post left AVF creation on 2011/01/02,
under regular hemodialysis QW1,3,5.
4. diabetic mellitus, with proliferative diabetic retinopathy with
fibrovascular proliferation and vitreous hemorrhage, status post
intravitrious(IVIA) and cryotherapy(OU);
5. previous ischemic stroke, with sequela of left hemiplagia in 2007;
6. hypertension

-Inactive problem-
1. peripheral occlusive arterial disease; severe stenosis at left popliteal
aretry and right anterior tibial artery;
2. pseudophakia(OS), cataract(OD);
3. hyperlipidemia;
4. nephrolithiasis, status post ESBL

[Brief history]
    He was admitted to our ward due to decompensated heart failure. While
arrival, blood pressure was around 75-80mmHg. Dopamine support started as a
continuous infusion rate of 5mcg/kg/min. Cardiac sonography showed dilated
LA, dilated LV, severe MR, and reduced LV systolic function(LVEF 35.8%).
Lab data showed no metabolic acidosis and normal serum level of lactic
acid. There was no electrolyte imbalance. His family had reported abdomen
distension with constipation for 2 days. Supraclavicular CVC insertion was
performed.

 07/03 Growning-> place to ward preparing room
 07/04 05:00 seizure-like, unresponsiveness-> recover
    bradycardia noted to 30bpm
  For abdominal pain-> KUB: bowel gas, stool impaction
    No free air in decubitus view
  Lab: metabolic acidosis with lactic acid elevation
  -> impression: Septic shock with metabolic acidosis
       09:00 ward: Apnea, PEA-> CPR for 6 min
       Coffee-ground substance from NG
  -> Transferred to 5CVI

[On service accessment]
  1. Regular heart beats, mild systolic murmur
  2. No basal lung crackles
  3. No pitting edema

Plan:
 1. Add UF with CVVH for iHD patient under shock status
 2. Rolikam for HCO3 supplement-> DC due to HCO3 normalized
 3. Dopamin 800mg/250ml run 7.3ml/hr, 5ug/kg/min-> keep
 4. Keep Tazocin as CVVH dosage->keep
 5. Purseu culture data
 6. Monitor calcium level, check sputum AFS, iPTH.
