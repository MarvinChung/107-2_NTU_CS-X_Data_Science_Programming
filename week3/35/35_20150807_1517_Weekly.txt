Brief Summary of this week
The patient's blood pressure was supported by dopamine 10mcg/kg/min, and
was arousal and alert with E4M5V6 most of the time. Intermittent agitation
was also noted. However, poor digestion was noted with abdominal fullness,
undigested milk drawn from gastric decompression and coffee-ground
substance noted with Hb decreased from 10 to 8 on 2015/8/7. Hence, enteral
feeding was held. Permcath implantation was done on 8/3 due to left AV
fistula dysfunction. Family meeting was held on 8/3 and transferring to
other medical facility was planned. However, his family wanted him to
suffer no more. Hence, they are currently decided to sign DNR including no
hemodialysis, no antibiotics, no transfusion and no increasing
pressor/inotropics. Multiprofessional meeting was held on 2015/8/7 and
decided to transfer the patient if still need hemodialysis or partial DNR.
If complete DNR signed and including no hemodialysis, in-hospital dying
prepare was suggested. Due to repeated nasal swab showed negative MRSA
colonization, no MRSA isolation is needed.
