2017-07-07: This 67-year-old man had underlying disease of:
1. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with terminal lung disease;
2. lung squamous cell carcinoma, right upper lobe, T2aN2M0, stage IIIA
He was admitted due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Intubation was done on 2017/6/28. Empirical Tazocin was given for suspected pneumonia. Inhaled NO was given in 6/29~30 with improved oxygenation. Systemic steroid was also given as suspected acute excerabtion of IPF. Though serial CXR showed decreased biltateral infiltraiton, bilateral pulmonary fibrosis persisted. Furthermore, the FiO2 was still high (FiO2: 60%) on high sedation demand (Fentanyl, Anxicam, Nimbex). The tappering of sedation was failed as desaturation ensued. Furthermore, septic shock developed again on 7/6. Poor prognosis of weaning from the ventilator and sedation was informed. Though DNR was confirmed, terminal withdraw was still hesitated.

太太:此為第二次插管，先生曾在第一次拔管後表示插管太痛苦。目前太太跟女兒皆瞭解病患的病況，無法脫離呼吸器，可能需要氣切。家屬也很清楚表示，不要氣切。目前也無法決定是否要撤除呼吸器還是轉往RCW。告知目前能做的部分肯定疾病治療歷程、肯定家人陪伴、鼓勵四道人生。
