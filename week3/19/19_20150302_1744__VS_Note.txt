Suggeset

-> PS weaning, then proceed into SBT
-> sinus bradycardia, lower BP while under RRT intermittent use of
vasopressor, reset SBP 90 or MBP 60 as patient's previous level of vital
sign
-> drowsiness while under Seroquel and oral sedative
-> NJ feeding improved
-> DC antibiotic
-> CT showed acute pancreatitis with suspected local fluid accumulation,
consider diagnositci paracentesis
-> adrenal insufficiency under stress dose steroid infusion
-> intermittent RRT for toxin removal
-> inform family critical condtions and further treatment plan
