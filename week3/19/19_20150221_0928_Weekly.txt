Brief Summary of this week
After admission, CVVH was started, and we added on Invanz and Cravit. On
2/16, shock was noted in the morning, ans hydration and Levophed were given
both; and the blood pressure returned to 105/44 mmHg in the afternoon; an
episode of seizure developed, and anxicam was given; and we added on
Teicoplanin for sputum smear GPC in clusters 3+. On 2/17, we tapered off
Levophed due to blood pressure up to 110/50 mmHg. On 2/18, the sputum
culture showed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 3+; and we tapered off the
CVVH. On 2/19 we DC Targocid due to no evident MRSA infection and r/o
Targocid related thrombocytopenia(PLT:92K(2/17)-->66K(2/18)-->47K(2/19)).

        off CVVH.
2/19 DC Targocid due to no evident MRSA infection and r/o Targocid related
thrombocytopenia(PLT:92K(2/17)-->66K(2/18)-->47K(2/19))
        Try Lasix for oliguria.  Try D5W feeding.


Plan
1. Keep Cravit (for SM and cover atypical infection)+ Invanz
2. Follow BUN/CRE/ABG; consider dialysis if progressed acidosis or
azotemia, deteriorated O2 demand
3. Beware of pancreatitis complications, may check autoimmune markers;
Abdominal CT may be indicated if there was persistent fever 1 week later;
monitor peritoneal signs.
4. Close monitor neurologic status, lumbar puncture not indicated now as no
evident signs of CNS infection, correct metabolic factors first
5. Try half milk feeding, taper TPN gradually(2/20要重開), self-paid nexium
use
6. The family consented on 不電不壓, 要洗腎
7. Consider further NJ tube insertion for re-feeding
