Suggeset

-> PS weaning, patient tolerated SBT
-> suspect autonomic dysfunction with intermittent low dose vasopresor use,
add on regular dose of midodrine
-> reset SBP 70~ 90 or MBP 50~60 as patient's previous level of vital sign
-> adjusted Seroquel and oral sedative
-> NJ feeding improved
-> add on ceftazidime for concern of nococomial infection
-> CT showed acute pancreatitis with suspected local fluid accumulation,
consider diagnositci paracentesis
-> adrenal insufficiency under stress dose steroid infusion
-> intermittent RRT for toxin removal
-> inform family critical condtions and further treatment plan
