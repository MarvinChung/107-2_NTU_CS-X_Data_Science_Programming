-> trial of PS weaning, progress to SBT
-> infrom family further weaning and extubtion plan
-> NJ feeding improved
-> CT showed acute pancreatitis with suspected local fluid accumulation,
consider diagnositci paracentesis
-> adrenal insufficiency under stress dose steroid infusion
-> consult radiologist for possible NJ insertion
-> broadspectrum antibiotic for coverage of IAI
-> intermittent RRT for toxin removal
-> inform family critical condtions and further treatment plan
