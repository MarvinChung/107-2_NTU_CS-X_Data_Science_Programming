Brief Summary of this week
After admission (2/15), septic shock, ACKD and anuria mandated treatment
with hydration, Levophed and CVVH. The blood pressure improved to 105/44 on
2/16. ETT+MV and broad spectrum antibiotics (Cravit for PsA, ertapenem for
ESBL, teicoplanin for sputum smear GPC in cluster 3+) were kept for
suspected septic lung, pancreatitis and IAI. TPN was administered for
pancreatitis and NPO. On 2/18, sputum yielded Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
3+, no MRSA. On 2/19, teicoplanin was discontinued. CVVH was discontinued
for improving hemodynamics. The urine output was still low (150mL per day)
and SLED was kept. On 2/20, another episode of GTC developed. Phenytoin was
loaded again. His respiratory condition improved gradually, so as the CXRs.
On 2/24, follow-up CT showed still swelling of pancreas, marked ascites
with suspected intraabdominal abscess formation. We kept medical treatment
rather than drainage. He became agitated consistently as we tapered down
sedatives. Consulted psychiatrist suggested to add flurazin first. On 2/25,
HLA-B1502 reported positive. Thus phenytoin was switched to Keppra
(Depakine may induce pancreatitis). He received NJ insertion for poor
digestion. The ETT dislodged in the evening and was re-inserted. Due to
poor consciousness and low tidal volume, the re-intubation risk was high.
Nevertheless, after discussion with his son, we decided not to create
tracheostomy this time. He tried SBT daily for preparation of extubation.
On 2/27, he tolerated feeding 500mL per day via NJT. NSVT 10 seconds at the
end of SLED occasionally. The K and Mg were borderline low. Supplement was
given. BP drop was noted during SLED on 3/2, and it improved after 40ml 50%
dextrose water injection. Since his condition was improving, and he did not
revealed any shock sign depite of low blood pressure(SBP 80~100), we
tapered his Levohped gradually and shifted to Midodrine use. He tolerated
daily SBT well and we extubated on 3/5 smoothly. We consulted psychiatrist
for his anti-schizophrenia agent and flurazin was tapered to 1# HS with
adding Zaprexa 1# HS. His urine output increased much since 3/6.

       remove his NJ by himeself; insert NG first, observe his digestion


Plan
1. Keep dialysis TIW for fluid overload and azotemia (set DW 52Kg)
2. Keep NJ feeding to 普寧腎1500Kcal/1000ml
3. Keep regular dose of midodrine
    Reset SBP goal to 70~ 90 or MBP 50~60mmHg .
4. Keep Ceftazidime for possible nosocomial infection. Pursue culture
results. Consider re-on DLC if still low grade fever.
5. The family (key person 大兒子) consented on 不電不壓, 要洗腎, 不重插
6. Monitor his respiratory pattern.
7. monitor his digestion status; if digestion is still poor, consider
consult GI for another NJ insertion
7. consider remove flurazin if stupor still
8. if no electrolyte imbalance, consider transfer to general ward
