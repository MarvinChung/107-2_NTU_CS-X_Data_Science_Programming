Brief Summary of this week
After admission, we keep ventilator support. Tazocin was given as empiric
antibiotic for pneumonia. His consciousness remained comatous. We consulted
neurologist due to pinpoint pupil and comatous. Ischemic encephalopathy,
basilar artery disease, brainstem infarction, or NCSE was suspected. The
family refused further investigation, due to poor baseline condition(his
daily activities was marked limited by dyspnea) and the patient had
requested "do not intubate" previously. They requested withdraw life-
sustaining device. We thus consulted hospice team for combine care. They
also gave instructions for withdraw. Breakthrough fever was noted on 3/6.
After discussing with family, antipyretic was given and no septic work up
was done.
