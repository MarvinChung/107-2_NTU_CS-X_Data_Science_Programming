73-year-old man:
1. COPD, GOLD stage IV
2. OHCA, s/p CPCR(>20 minutes), s/p ROSC

*The patient was admitted to ICU via ER due to OHCA s/p ROSC. The patient
was followed at NTUH chest OPD since 2007 with severe COPD with admission
for many times and had been intubated before. Terminal stage is deemed by
primary care team.
- DNR(+)(同意書全拒), consiousness comatous (not under sedation now), ECOG
4, FLACC 0/10
- 後事未交代, 家屬已準備.
- key person: 子女共同決定.
- 與大女兒及同住的三女兒會談: 向兩位女兒確認: 表示家屬有共識, 希望儘快拔管.


*Suggestion:
1. I have introduced hospice combined care to the 1st and 3rd daughter of
the patient.
2. I have briefly explained the process and preparation of medical team and
family before ventilator withdrawal. 鼓勵家屬說出道別話語及遺憾.
3. We will arrange hospice combined care first. Contact 67940西址共照辦公室
for further questions. Thanks for consultation!
