Brief Summary of this week    
The hemodynamic became stable so CVVH was discontinued and diuretic agent was given for oliguria. The urine output was adequete. Fever was noted again on 5/15 so septic workup was performed and Ampicillin was upgraded to Targocid empirically. The sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas and high procalcitonin was noted. So Cravit was added. Mepem was discontinued after completing 14-day course. Her family asked for hospice combined care due to terminal stage of cancer so FM specialist was consulted and hospice combined care was arranged. The family reached the consensus not to titrate up inotropics anymore and not to do re-intubation if extubation failure. Supportive care was kept.

[Important consultations]
5/18 Hospice: 與病人先生及妹妹會談, 他們了解病人病況不穩且預後很難預測. 病人意識及疾病認知程度較難評估, 家屬也不知道如何向病人說明現況, 鼓勵家屬以字卡溝通關懷. 家人過去有因糖尿病而截肢的經驗, 以先生對病患的了解, 尊重不主動截肢的決定. 家屬也明白壞疽可能成為感染源. 說明安寧照顧內涵, 家屬接受安寧共照且希望加強疼痛控制. 肯定家屬對病人的關懷與努力

[Important family's decision]
5/07 signed DNR(不電不壓), 不上第三線升壓藥
5/08 explained poor prognosis; informed difficult CVVH (easily clotted) and possible further hypotension ==> could understand
5/17 inform the possibility of infection due to ischemic limb, her husband hope not to do amputation even if infection
5/18 Hospice combined care, 升壓藥不再上調
5/20 Inform weaning plan, family decided 拔管後不再重插

Plan 
1. Targocid for U/C: Enterococcus faecalis, may DC if B/C negative; keep Cravit for sputum stenotrophomonas
2. Target Dry BW 50kg, monitoring U/O and CVP level; hydration PRN to keep I/O balance under diuretic phase.
3. Keep ventilator support; weaning gradually.
4. Keep bilateral PCN drainage
5. Hospice combined care
