[Important consultations]
5/18 Hospice: 與病人先生及妹妹會談, 他們了解病人病況不穩且預後很難預測. 病人意識及疾病認知程度較難評估, 家屬也不知道如何向病人說明現況, 鼓勵家屬以字卡溝通關懷. 家人過去有因糖尿病而截肢的經驗, 以先生對病患的了解, 尊重不主動截肢的決定. 家屬也明白壞疽可能成為感染源. 說明安寧照顧內涵, 家屬接受安寧共照且希望加強疼痛控制. 肯定家屬對病人的關懷與努力

5/17 inform the possibility of infection due to ischemic limb, her husband hope not to do amputation even if infection
5/18 Hospice combined care, 升壓藥不再上調
