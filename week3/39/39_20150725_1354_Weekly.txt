Brief Summary of this week
After admission, aggresive compnenet therapy was prescribed. Hypotension
with about 200ml GI bleeding was noted in 07/03 morning. Levophed was on.
Consulted GS and PES first with closely monitor was suggested. PES on 07/03
showed Gastric ulcer, A1 but Gastroenterologist suggested the ulcer was not
likely the source of bleeding. BP was stablized by component therapy and
levophed was off. On 07/07, PEG was performed again and the result showed
suspicious of post-TAE gastopathy but stomach perforation could not be
excluded. Abdominal+Pelvic CT on 07/07 didn't show free air but spleenic
and liver infarction was found. Liver profile was elevated but improved.
Feeding was tried 3 time since 07/10 but GI bleeding with Hb drop was noted
in each milk feeding. Third upper GI endoscope was performed on 07/21 and
1. Gastric ulcers, fundus and upper body, suspected post-TAE related
2.Gastric tumor, AW, upper body, r/o pseudoaneurysm was noted.
CPAP was also tried intermittently since 07/10 and dyspnea was noted in
trying.
Besdies, VRE in A-line and CVC blood culture was noted in 07/16. Sputum
culture also showed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Antibiotic was adjusted
to Daptomycin+ cravit+ Tinem. Familiy meeting was arranged on 07/17 and
transient sedation for emotional support was agreed.
