<Inactive problems>
1.VRE bacteremia, improved
5.CAD-3VD, s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD; SVG-Dx1-OM1-OM2-PDA) in 1992, with SVG
stenosis, s/p POBAS to SVG in 2002, recurrence and complicated with STEMI,
s/p POBAS to SVG in 2011, under aspirin

Aorta-bifemoral grafting in 2008
7.Gouty arthritis
8.Hypothyroidism, under Eltroxin
9.Hypertension
10.Diabetes mellitus
11.Dyslipidemia

<Treatment course>
After admission, one fever episode occurred on 2015/8/6. Since nosocomial
infection could not be ruled out, we added Tazocin for infection control.
However, blood culture showed fungemia thus we checked MIC level and
administrated Diflucan. She kept afebrile since 8/7.

However, coffee ground vomitus was noted during her weaning progragm. We
consulted GI specilist, and medical treatment was suggested instead of EGD.
After discussing to her family, they refuse further operation or TAE. We
also consulted chest surgeon for further tracheostomy. The family expressed
their willing for withdraw or further hospice care. Thus we also consulted
psychologist and hospice doctor for her further plan.
Repeated fungemia was noted stil after 12 days of Diflucan use. We
consulted infection specilaist and we elevated diflucan dose first due to
low MIC level, and then shifted antibiotics to Anidulafungin due to severe
sepsis. Tracheostomy was discontinued due to severe sepsis and elevated O2
demand, too. However, due to disease progression and prolonged intubation
course, the patient and her family requested for discontinuing antibiotics
use. After well informing the current critical condition and discussing
with hospice doctor, the patient and her family  still insisted on
discontinuing antibiotics use. Thus, after signing 切結書 and DNR同意書, we
hold antibiotics use since 8/21.

<Important intervention>
7/03 TAE: with gelfoam fine particles in the LGA

<Important study findings>
7/10 CXR: Left pleural effusion
7/03 PES: Gastric ulcer, A1,Forrest III,upper body (not be likely the
bleeder)
7/03 TAE: Angiography showed hyperemic patch and a tiny pseudoaneurysm of
the stomach supplied by LGA
7/03 CTA: active bleeding in stomach
7/07 PES: Susp. post-TAE gastopathy, r/o stomach perforation
7/07 A+P CT: GI bleeding with gastric hematoma status post TAE
Infarct, lateral segment of liver and spleen.

Gastric tumor, AW, upper body, r/o pseudoaneurysm

<Lab>
8/9 FeUN 51%, FeNa 1.25% --> intrinsic

<Consultation>
7/21 GS: Gastrectomy or suture ligation of bleeders is risky.
         suggest less-invasive procedure such as endoscopic hemostasis and
component therapy.
8/11 CV: add lidocain and f/u cardiac enzyme+ECG Q12H; wait for cardiac
echo
8/13 GI: endoscopy could do no help to gastric pseudoaneurysm, suggest TAE
or surgical intervention.

<Family decision>
2015/7 Family: DNR除插管、不洗腎
8/11 informed family about risk of sudden death due to NSVT and MI/heart
failure hx. Reconfirmed family about DNR.
8/14 family refused further TAE if UGI rebleeding(noted on DNR)

大兒子表示已經攜帶胰島素瓶來探視母親好多天，想自己給母親施打來了結她的痛苦；
詢問我們能否幫她施打一整瓶。(已嚴正說明此作法不可行，經說明給予鎮靜止痛藥物並
安排氣切後可接受。)

8/10 NPO due to poor gastric empty time and vomitus
8/21 the patient and her family request for
DNR全拒不給抗生素及其他侵入性治療, signed 切結書

<Plan>
1. hold antibiotics use
2. Monior low HCO3.  Soda supply.
3. Low dose fentanyl for sedation.
