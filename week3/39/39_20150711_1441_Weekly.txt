Brief Summary of this week
After admission, aggresive compnenet therapy was prescribed. Hypotension
with about 200ml GI bleeding was noted in 07/03 morning. Levophed was on.
Consulted GS and PES first with closely monitor was suggested. PES on 07/03
showed Gastric ulcer, A1 but Gastroenterologist suggested the ulcer was not
likely the source of bleeding. BP was stablized by component therapy and
levophed was off. On 07/07, PEG was performed again and the result showed
suspicious of post-TAE gastopathy but stomach perforation could not be
excluded. Abdominal+Pelvic CT on 07/07 didn't show free air but spleenic
and liver infarction was found. Hepatic profile was also elevated. Water
was tried since 07/09 but Hb was dropped with few blood content from NG.
Therefore, she was kept NPO.
