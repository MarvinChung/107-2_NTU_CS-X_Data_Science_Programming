Brief Summary of this week
The blood culture revealed VRE bacteremia. We consulted the ID specialist
and the antibiotic was shift to Linezolid. The NJ reinsertion was arranged
on 9/3 due to NJ dysfunciton. The gastric-biliary fistula was noted
accidentally during NJ insertion. We consulted GI specialist and the
bedside echogram showed pneumobilia which was compatible with gastric-
biliary fistula. Fever was note again on 9/4. The antibiotic was shift to
Cravit, Colistin, Zyvox and anidulafingin. We arranged family meeting on
9/5. The DNR全拒 was favored. The progressive oligouria was noted. The
follow-up lab data also revealed deteriorated renal function and elevated
liver function. Since that, we hold Colistin administration. We titrated up
the diuretic dose for adequate urine output. The poor digestive function
was noted. Since that, we hold enteral feeding and administered D50W. Her
family confirmed the DNR status and no further renal replacement therapy.
We informed the grave prognosis if deteriorated renal function to his
family and they understood. They wished to let the patient receive
palliative care. Low blood pressure and conscious dorwsiness were noted on
9/12. The combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis were
susepcted. The low dose levophed was added and the sedative agents were
hold.
