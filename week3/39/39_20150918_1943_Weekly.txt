Brief Summary of this week
At ward, we informed the poor prognosis to the family. Decreased coffee
ground material Try D5W feeding from ND tube, and gradually increase
feeding amount. Lasix added to 2 ml/hr, increased urine output to
1010ml/day. Some family members are considering 移除維生醫療. Large amount
of coffee ground substance was found from NG on 9/18, therefore, we hold ND
feeding. Family meeting with hospice team was held on 9/18. We agree with
移除維生醫療, and the family refused 輸血, 抗生素治療, 升壓藥, 心臟按摩,
電擊, 洗腎, 動脈栓塞止血.
