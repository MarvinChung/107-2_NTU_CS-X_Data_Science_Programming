<Diagnosis>
1.Gastric pseudoaneurysm bleeding with shock, s/p TAE on 7/03, rebleeding,
improved
2. Acute respiratory failure, type IV, s/p ETT+MV(2015/7/3-)
3. Candidas albican fungemia, CRBSI, r/o liver abscess or IE
4. RML lobar pneumonia, Ventilator associated
5. Fluid overload
6. ACKD, stage IV-V, improved (baseline creatinine at 1.9-2.0)
7. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, suspected pre-ESRD related
8. Elevated liver profile, suspected TAE related liver infarction, improved

<Treatment course>
After admission, one fever episode occurred on 2015/8/6. Since nosocomial
infection could not be ruled out, we added Tazocin for infection control.
However, blood culture showed fungemia thus we checked MIC level and
administrated Diflucan. She kept afebrile since 8/7.

However, coffee ground vomitus was noted during her weaning progragm. We
consulted GI specilist, and medical treatment was suggested instead of EGD.
After discussing to her family, they refuse further operation or TAE. We
also consulted chest surgeon for further tracheostomy. The family expressed
their willing for withdraw or further hospice care. Thus we also consulted
psychologist and hospice doctor for her further plan.
Repeated fungemia was noted stil after 12 days of Diflucan use. We
consulted infection specilaist and we elevated diflucan dose first due to
low MIC level, and then shifted antibiotics to Anidulafungin due to severe
sepsis. Tracheostomy was discontinued due to severe sepsis and elevated O2
demand, too. However, due to disease progression and prolonged intubation
course, the patient and her family requested for discontinuing antibiotics
use. After well informing the current critical condition and discussing
with hospice doctor, the patient and her family  still insisted on
discontinuing antibiotics use. Thus, after signing 切結書 and DNR同意書, we
hold antibiotics use since 8/21 night. However, her family regretted and we
re-administrated antibiotics since 8/22. Family meeting was held on
2015/8/27, and they made a consensus of DNR全拒 with antibiotics use. Under
relatively stable condition, we consulted ENT doctor for tracheostomy on
2015/8/28 and tracheostomy was arranged on 2015/8/31.

<Important intervention>
7/03 TAE: with gelfoam fine particles in the LGA
7/29 ND insertion for feeding

bleeder)

the stomach supplied by LGA
7/03 CTA: active bleeding in stomach

<Lab>
8/9 FeUN 51%, FeNa 1.25% --> intrinsic

<Consultation>
7/21 GS: Gastrectomy or suture ligation of bleeders is risky.
         suggest less-invasive procedure such as endoscopic hemostasis and
component therapy.
8/11 CV: add lidocaine and f/u cardiac enzyme+ECG Q12H; wait for cardiac
echo
8/13 GI: endoscopy could do no help to gastric pseudoaneurysm, suggest TAE
or surgical intervention.
8/20 ID: suggested UCG for persistent fungemia, r/o IE
8/28 ENT: for tracheostomy

<Family decision>
2015/7 Family: DNR除插管、不洗腎
8/11 informed family about risk of sudden death due to NSVT and MI/heart
failure hx. Reconfirmed family about DNR.
8/14 family refused further TAE if UGI rebleeding(noted on DNR)
8/10 NPO due to poor gastric empty time and vomitus
8/11 Short-run VT was noted at AM(no formal record)
     DNR不電不壓 and keep natural course if fatal VT occurrs
8/12 Contact with CV => keep lidocain for 2 days, keep close observation
8/13 Consult GI => no further treatment effective for pseudoaneurysm
     Consult radioloigst for ND tube insertion
8/14 T-P 1hr: failed in 15 minutes, tachypnea
8/15 Consult CS for tracheostomy
     resume feeding with 半奶
8/21 After well-informing the patient, all of her children made a consensus
of discontinuing Abx treatment and signed 切結書, including DNR同意書,全拒
(病人點頭表示同意)
=> discontinue antibiotics since 8/21
8/22 Her eldest son asked for resume antibiotics (he has already signed the
切結書 and DNR同意書 for refusing antibiotics therapy due to severe
sepsis). I asked her children to discuss again, and then they re-accepted
antibiotics therapy. Anidulafungin and Cefepime were resumed in the evening
on 8/22
8/27 family meeting => keep antibiotics and perform tracheostomy if
feasible; keep DNR全拒不洗腎不TAE
8/28 family agreed tracheostomy.

<Plan>
1. Keep empiric cefepime and anidulafungin
   Pending culture data. Repeat B/C on 8/26.
   If pneumonia improved, consider stop cefepime.
2. DNR除呼吸器, 院宣; keep antibiotics use
3. Cash albumin supplement for severe hypoalbuminemia
4. Wait for tracheostomy on 2015/8/31. Consider protocoled weaning after
tracheostomy.tics since 8/21
