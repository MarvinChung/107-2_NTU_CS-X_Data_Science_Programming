Brief Summary of this week
After admission, one fever episode occurred on 2015/8/6. Since nosocomial
infection could not be ruled out, we added Tazocin for infection control.
However, blood culture showed fungemia thus we checked MIC level and
administrated Diflucan. She kept afebrile since 8/7.

Plan
1. Keep Tazocin and diflucan. Pending final pathogen and fungus MIC
2. Increased milk ND feeding to 50ml/hr since 8/7.
3. Keep NG drainage, shift PPI to oral form
