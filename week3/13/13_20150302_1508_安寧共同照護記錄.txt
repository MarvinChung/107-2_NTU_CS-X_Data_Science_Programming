61M:
1. CAD, 3VD, complicated with inferior STEMI and CAVB, Killip IV, with
IHCA, s/p CPCR with ROSC(11 minutes), s/p primary PCI with stent to RCA
2. Liver and renal failure, under CVVH
3. Acute ischemic stroke, bilateral cerebellum

*The patient was admitted to CV ICU due to STEMI complicated with IHCA.
Poor treatment response and grave prognosis with possible terminal status
was deemed by primary care team. We are consulted for ventilator
withdrawal.
- DNR(+)(除插管除藥除人工呼吸), consiousness comatous, ECOG 4
- 家屬知病知末, 後事已備, 院宣
- 與案兒子會談: 家屬皆有撤除呼吸器共識, 但具體時間尚未決定 (預計為3/3早上),
3/2下午三四點家屬會來ICU確定時間.

*Suggestion:
1. I have introduced withdrawal process and preparation. I have confirmed
funeral preparation with family.
2. I have given withdrawal protocol to primary resident. Ventilator
withdrawal may proceed after terminal status and informed consent of the
family is confirmed.
3. 請協助家屬簽署末期病人撤除維生醫療同意書.
4. 請協助在portal上註記末期及DNR.
5. Contact 63274東址共照辦公室 for related problems. Thanks for your
consultation!
