61M,
1. CAD, 3VD, complicated with inferior STEMI, Killip class IV, with IHCA,
s/p CPCR with ROSC(11 minutes), s/p primary PCI with stent to RCA
2. Acute liver injury, suspect shock related
3. UGI bleeding, source?
4. Hypertension
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
6. Internal carotid artery stenosis (laterality unknown)

Hypothermic therapy started 2/21
Stopped due to acute GI bleeding (fresh blood from NG)

profound shock under Levophed + dopamine, shock liver, Cre 1.6 under CVVH

CT: hydrocephalus, hypodensity at cerebellum and brain stem
EEG: diffuse cortical dysfunction

ABP: 104/42mmHg, HR: 98, sinus with VPC, SpO2: 100%
E1VTM1, pupil dilated
family preferred withdrawl of life support system

polyuria 2000ml, central DI, response to DDAVP
hyperNa 160 ->158 -> 150
BW 65.6kg

Plan:
1. Discontinue DAPT due to acute GI bleeding, consider add back plavix if
bleeding subsided
2. Component therapy, keep Hb>10, PPI use for ulcer prophylaxis
3. Explain to family (DNR 不電不壓) and inform grave prognosis
4. Taper dopamine and levophed
5. hold CVVH, if acidosis, SLEDD
6. add DDAVP PRN for central DI if UOP > 3000
