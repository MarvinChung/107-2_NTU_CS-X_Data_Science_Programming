3. UGI bleeding, source?
4. Hypertension
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
6. Internal carotid artery stenosis (laterality unknown)

Hypothermic therapy started 2/21
Stopped due to acute GI bleeding (fresh blood from NG)

profound shock under Levophed + dopamine, shock liver, Cre 1.6 under CVVH

ABP: 125/54mmHg, HR: 98, sinus with VPC, SpO2: 100%
E1VTM1, pupil dilated
family preferred withdrawl of life support system

Plan:

bleeding subsided
2. Component therapy, keep Hb>10, PPI use for ulcer prophylaxis
3. Explain to family (DNR 不電不壓) and inform grave prognosis
4. Taper dopamine and levophed
5. hold CVVH, if acidosis, SLEDD
