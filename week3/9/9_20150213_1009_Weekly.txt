Brief Summary of this week
This is a 61 y/o woman with history of breast cancer, s/p chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. Multiple bone metastases at left ribs, L3 & L5 vertebrae, and
right ischial bone was noted by whole body bone FDG. Last year as her CEA
and CA15-3 level elevated, her doctor discussed target therapy with her,
but she decided not to have any aggresive medicine any more.

This time, she felt right hip pain and painful disability after standing up
on 2014/01/16. She received tumor curettage and internal fixation for right
proximal femur at ER.After operation, he was transferred to SICU for
further care. An episode of fever was noted on 1/26, septic workup was
done. Chest echo showed right pleural effusion, 2cm. Consciousness
progressed to drowsy with AFRVR, hypotension. Levophed and hydration were
given. Meantime, severe diarrhea was also noted. Due to incurable
underlying, DNR was discussed with family. Extubation was performed on 2/1.
She was transferred to general ward on 2/2 for further supportive care

Her fever and dyspnea gradually improved after Levofloxacin were given. She
also compalined about her right arm edema, diuretics was given. And with
water restriction, edema was therefore controlled. Morphine injection and
Indomethacin was also given in order to release her bone pain.

As her condition stablized without fever nor dyspnea, we suggest her to do
some rehabilitation and discusss the optimal time to get ready to
discharge.
