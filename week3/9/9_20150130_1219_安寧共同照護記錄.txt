61F:
1. Right breast cancer, s/p breast-conservation surgery + axillary lymph
node dissection, with multiple bone metastasis
2. Right femoral pathological fracture, s/p operation

*The patient was transferred to ICU due to massive intra-operation and
suspected tumor pulmonary emboli. The current plan of primary care team is
to try weaning. Patient had signed advanced care plan with DNR and hospice
care (with 健保卡註記) when her is clear. Family agreed DNR and preferred
not to re-intubation.

*Assessment:
- DNR(+), under ICU sedation, FLACC 0/10
- key: 大兒子
- 與兩名兒子會談: 病人清醒時有預立DNR醫囑, 並提到入住安寧病房.
病人已交代後事. 提醒家屬後事準備.

*Suggestion:
1. Try weaning as your expertise.
2. I have introduced hospice combined care to 1st and 2nd son of patient.
3. If patient is expected to expire in few days despite current life-
sustaining medical treatments, may discuss with family about withhold life-
sustaining measurements.
4. We will arrange combined care. Thanks for your consultation. Contact us
for further questions (63274東址共照辦公室).
