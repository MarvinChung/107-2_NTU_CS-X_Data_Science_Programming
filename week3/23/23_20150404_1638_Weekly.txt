Brief Summary of this week
This week, we no longer conduct prone position since 4/3 for it showed
littile improvement. No more fever was noted. CXR also showed resolution.
Keep tapering iNO.


Assessment
Cravit (3/27-)
Tamiflu (3/27-4/3)

iNO 3/28-
Prone 3/28-4/3

afebrile
ABP 105/66 mmHg under Levophed 4 mcg/min

Head and neck swelling due to prone position
HEENT: conjunctiva: not pale, no icteric sclera
heart: regular
Chest: symmetric expansion, crackles bilaterally, no wheeze
abdomen: soft and flat, no tenderness, normoactive BoS
Limbs: no more pitting edema.

3/27 admitted to 3C2 MICU for hypoxic RF. -> ETT+MV, also on CVC and
Levophed for transient hypotension after Dormicum.
3/28 O2 demand elevted significantly, SpO2 80~90% under FiO2 100%
=> prone position => FiO2 65% ->SpO2 95%
CXR: diffuse opacities over bilateral lungs, R>L; air-bronchogram(+)
3/29   easily desaturation when prone-> supine
          P/F ration 123->109 => on iNO in the evening, strart form 15 ppm
3/30  AfRVR => add Herbesser
prone: FiO2 45% PaO2 93 PF ratio 146;
supine: FiO2 70% PaO2 120 PF ratio: 170
better digestion, diest 500Kcal->1000Kcal
3/31  still AfRVR, ECG: no QTc prolong => add amiodarone
prone ABG: FiO2 45% PaO2 86  PF ratio  191
supine ABG FiO2 45% PaO2 79  PF ratio  175
=> keep prone
4/1  PF(supine): 177
4/2  PF(prone): 166 → supine for 6 hours, PF: 174
4/3 hold prone position due to no more effect
      iNO:5→2.5
4/4 iNO:2.5→1.9


Plan
1. Keep Cravit use. Pursue the culture result.
2. DC Solu-medrol 40mg Q8H for no obvious improvement with PF ration
    Taper iNO gradually
3. Intensive chest care, sputum suction and mucolytic agent sue.
4. Keep Procaterol. Consider add SABA if high resistance. Consider seretide
use after DC iNO
