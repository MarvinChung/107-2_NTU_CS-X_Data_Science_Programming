Brief Summary of this week
The chest tightness was noted since 5/10. EKG showed V3-V6 ST depression,
and the cardiac enzyme was not elevated. Unstable angina was impressed. We
had contacted with Dr. 張博淵, who suggested not suitable to PCI. NTG
infusion was applied and switched to oral ismo-20. However, dyspnea occured
and excerbated this week, the followed-up chest Xray showed improved
pulmonary edema. No obivious infection sign was noted. The ACS with lung
edema or nosocomial pneumonia was suspected. We started empirical
antibiotics with Fortum. After discussed with family, we presribed Morphin
as symptom reliever.
