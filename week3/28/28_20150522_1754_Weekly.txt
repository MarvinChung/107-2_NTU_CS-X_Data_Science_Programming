Brief Summary of this week
This week, the dyspnea symptom excerbated. We arranged cardiac echo which
revealed regional wall motion abnormalities. Hence, we suspected the chest
discomfort on 5/10 might be a NSTEMI. Nevertheless, after discussed with
her family, we kept the palliative treatment. We adjusted the morphin
dosage to 2mg SC Q6H use. Also, we had contacted with Dr. 賴俊夫 for the HD
issue. The family meeting was hold on W5 with Dr. 賴俊夫 and hospice care
nurse, and the family expressed the willing of withdraw the HD.
Currently, we will keep morphin use and considering adjust the HD
frequency.
