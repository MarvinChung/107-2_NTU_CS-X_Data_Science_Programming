[Brief history]
After admission, we kept antibiotic treatment for pneumonia, and shifted
antibiotics to ceftazidimefrom 4/28 for 14 days by the suggestion of ID
specialist Dr. Chang. The patient complained about progressive right foot
pain and worsening of the right ankle ulcer from 4/27. The cardiologist Dr
Chang and Dr Lee suggested re-evaluation and possible revascularization.
The chest radiograph on 4/30 reassured improving pneumonia, while the blood
test showed elevated white cell count.
On 4/30, the patient complained chest tightness and mild dyspnea. The EKG
and cardiac enzymes did not favor new acute myocardial infarction.
On 5/1, the patient's activity decreased gradually and the consciousness
drowsiness developed on 5/4. On examination, the patient was arousable but
drowsy and disoriented. The right hemiplegia was stationary, while the left
muscle power decreased from 3+~4 to 2+. There were no signs of increased
intracranial pressure. The laboratory study showed mildly elevated BUN and
ammonia, which were corrected after scheduled hemodialysis on 5/4. The
emergent brain CT scan without contrast reassured no new intracranial
hemorrhage. The oral gabapentin (自備) was discontinued, and the patient
was nil per os. The consciousness improved gradually from 5/5 and was
totally clear on 5/8.
On 5/4, the patient's youngest daughter visited the Head Nurse of the
Hospice Ward, and requested hospice combined care. The family members
discussed with hospice specialist on 5/4 and entered combined care program.
The patient herself signed DNR on 5/6. They had discussed about withdrawing
regular hemodialysis and turning to hospice care, but had not reached a
conclusion yet.
The chest tightness was noted again since 5/10. EKG showed V3-V6 ST
depression, and the cardiac enzyme was not elevated. Unstable angina, TIMI
4 was impressed. We contacted with Dr. 張博淵, who suggested not suitable
to PCI. NTG infusion was applied and switched to oral ismo-20. However,
dyspnea occured and excerbated this week, the followed-up chest Xray showed
improved pulmonary edema. No obivious infection sign was noted. The ACS
with lung edema or nosocomial pneumonia was suspected. We started empirical
antibiotics with Fortum. After discussed with family, we presribed Morphin
as symptom reliever. We arranged cardiac echo on 5/19, which revealed
regional wall motion abnormalities and decrease LVEF. After discussed with
her family, we kept the palliative treatment. We adjusted the morphin
dosage to 2mg SC Q6H use. Also, we had contacted with Dr. 賴俊夫 for the HD
issue. The family meeting was held on W5 with Dr. 賴俊夫 and hospice care
nurse, and the family expressed the willing of withdraw the HD. We switched
morphin to Fantanyl patch by the suggestion of Dr. 賴 for the possible
complication of morphin accumulation. An episode of fever was noted on
5/25. We added empirical antibiotics and hydration support.
We will keep hospice care and discussed with family about withdraw HD.

*Consultation
contact with Dr. 張博淵
>>> keep hospice care, morphin controlled, oxygen support

contact with hospice care
>>> adjust morphin dosage, 已排入病房等候名單

contact with Dr. 賴俊夫
>>> will discussed with family about the HD issue
>>> fair response to HD. Fear of possible morphine complication,
considering Fentanyl patch, elevated morphine dosage to 1.5mg Q4H

contact with 藥師:
>>> fentanyl patch, difficult to control the dosage and the risk of
respiratory depression.

1. Hospice care
2. Hemodialysis QW2,4,6
3. dyspnea controlled with fentanyl patch 12.5mg
4. empirical abx
