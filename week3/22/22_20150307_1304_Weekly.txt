Treatment  3/2-3/7
      CVC blood culture showed Staphylococcus lugdunensis, sensitive to
oxacillin, so we discontinued vancomycin and keep Tazocin use. Relative
adrenal insufficiency was found, ACTH/Cortiso 19.7/7.85 so steroid was used
until levophed tappered off. Increased urine output with progressive
hypernatremia developed, central diabetes mellutis, related hypoxic
encephalopathy was diagnosed. D5W hydration and desmopressin use were given
and electrolyte and urine output gradually normalized.
      We contacted social worker and he clarified that nursing home
director was not eligible to be her surrogate, he will
contact her son through 社會局. Tazocin was downgraded to cefmetazole used
due to no Pseudomonas pneumonia evidence. Regular oral desmopressin 0.05mg
BID with titration was kept to prevent rebound central diabetes mellitus.

<Plan>
1.  Keep CMZ use, total course 10 days
2.  Give regular desmopressin use due to rebound cDI, F/u
        Na closely
3.  Social worker is contacting her son, no response now
4.  Keep ventilator support PCV mode
