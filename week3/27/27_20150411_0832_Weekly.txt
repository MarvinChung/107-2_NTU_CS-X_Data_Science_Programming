Brief Summary of this week
Over this week, the patient presented with persistent fever. Given jaundice
appearance, tea-colored urine and thrombocytopenia, we checked bilirubin
level, haptoglobulin and DIC panel. The results demonstrated DIC process
most likely attributed to severe infection. Cravit was added on 4/6 for
suspected atypical infection. Fever and desaturation occurred on 4/7 night,
we redo septic workup and added on diflucan. From 4/8 desaturation has
persisted so that FiO2 has been gradually upgraded to 75%. On 4/9 night
fever and desaturation attacked again, Vancomycin was added. Concerned with
high oxygen demand, we begun iNO supplement on 4/9. Methylprednisolone
(1mg/kg/day) was started from 4/10.
