The patient is a 82 y/o gentleman, with the underlying condition of 
1.amylotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and is currently under home ventilator support. 
   He experienced an episode of sputum impaction, which resulted in OHCA. CPCR 26 mins was performed, with ROSC. However, hypoxic-ichemic encephalopathy was the sequele, with isoelectric EEG pattern with poor cortical response of SSEP was noted. Poor prognosis along with the possibility of being in vegetative state is informed to the patient's family.
  We were consulted for hospice combined care.
