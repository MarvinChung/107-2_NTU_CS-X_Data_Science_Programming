Brief Summary of this week    
After transfer to hospice ward, we completed the 8-day-treatment course of Ceftazidime for urinary tract infection. Scopolamin was administered for intermittent heavy sweating. Frequent posture change and chest care were suggested for bed-ridden status. Poor prognosis was explained to the family and we assisted with advanced care plan. After discussion with the patient's mother, she wished not to take further life prolonging action to avoid patient suffering. We administered intensive symptomatic treatment and assited with advanced care plan. 
  He had frequent pridocal limbs movement with agitation, especillay when he was discomfort. The Foley tube obstruction once on 4/18 with fever, profound weating and agitation, which resolved after Foley tube exchange. 
  The frequency of frequent pridocal limbs movemen increased recently, with profound sweating increased. The care giver reported patient seems to have positive response to the question if he had headache. Acetaminophen was used but the effect was limited, so we administered ultracet, and later shift to morphine solution 2mL. After morphine use, agitation, sweating, and decerebrate posture frequencty decrease.
