Brief Summary of this week
After admission, CVVH was started on 11/25 for severe lactic acidosis.
Maxpime and metronidazole were given for Enterobacter bacteremia and
suspected left psoas muscle pyomyositis. His consciousness gradually became
clear and vasopressor was tapered.
   Radiologist was consulted on 11/26 for psoas abscess, while CT-guided
drainage was not feasible. CVVH was discontinued on 11/27 morning for
improved acidosis. Large amount of tarry stool was noted, and component
therapy was given. B/C (11/24 specimen) yielded Enterobacter aerogenes, and
S/C (11/24 specimen) yielded P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. So
Maxipime was not changed. Recurrent fever was noted on 11/27 evening, and
workup was repeated. SLED was started on 11/28 for fluid overload. NG
feeding with D5W was started on 11/29. Furosemide continuous infusion was
started on 11/29 for oliguria. However, poor response with fluid overload
still persisted. Cash albumin was given. CVVH was also started since 11/30,
but clots were noted frequently, so the CVVH was discontinued on 12/1, and
shifted back to SLED.
   Low grade fever with consciousness drowsy occurred again on 12/3. Under
the susepct of infection poor control, abdominal CT was arranged on 12/4
and it showed enlarged L't psoas muscle abscess size with suspect multiple
L't renal abscess. Antibiotic as upgraded to Tygacil and Fortum. We also
consulted radiologist again and pigtail was placed on 12/4. The blood
culture via CVC showed ampicillin resistant Enterococcus, so Vancomycin was
added. CVC was removed and a new one was placed. After there managements,
his fever seems subsided gradaully. The consciousness was also improved.
However, NG coffee ground was noted since 12/4. NPO with IV PPI were given.
We consulted GI man for EGD, but GI man thought that his condition was not
suitable for EGD due to no family permit. His GI bleeding was improved
gradually under conservative treatment. NG feeding was restarted since
12/11.
   The final psoas muscle abscess culture revealed Enterobacter aerogenes.
We de-escalated antibiotic to Maxipime only according to drug sensitivity
test. However, low grade fever with consciounsess drowsy occurred since
12/10. Teicoplanin was added for GPC coverage. Paracentesis was done and
high LDH was noted during ascites study. We will keep following up his
condition, if persistent fever or GI symptoms(abdominal distention, poor
digestion..), further abdominal CT might be arranged.

Assessment
ABx: Maxipime 12/10-, Targocid 12/10-, Valtrex 12/9-;
        s/p Vancomycin 12/6-12/8, s/p Maxipime 11/24-12/4,
        s/p Tigacyl 12/4-12/10, Ceftazidime 12/4-12/10

SBP 90-110 mmHg on Levophed 2mcg/min
PCV: IP14  PEEP6  FiO2:0.3 => Tv:609, MV:9.5, SpO2 97-99%

Abd.CT(12/4): Suspected left iliopsoas abscess. Suspected left renal
abscess
=> iliopsoas abscess became larger compare to previous image
=> s/p small size pig-tail drainage due to limited safe margin, exchange a
larger one pigtail will be done on 12/5 afternoon
=> 12/5 Pigtail revision
=> 12/11 Pigtail revision again, now drainage amount:20ml/24hrs

less NG coffee ground drainage
=> GI specialist refused performing EGD due to no permit from family
=> resume feeding on 12/11, no coffee ground, but digestion poor

low grade fever since 12/10, s/p septic workup
mild ascites, s/p diagnostic paracentesis
Ascites LDH:1093(high!!) => cause? perforate bowel ??

E4VtM4-5, drowsy
HEENT: anicteric sclera, pale conjunctiva
Heart: RHB, no obvious murmur
Chest: Bilateral rhonchi
Abdomen: distended, silent bowel sounds
Extremities: pitting edema 2+, free movable; ischemic changed over
bilateral feet, especially left toes

Culture: S/C: PsA (S to Maxipime)
         B/C(12/4) CVC: Enterococcus faecalis/faecium
         Abscess/C:Enterobacter aerogenes

12/9 有一位女士(台大心理系教授
連韻文)表示是病人十多年的朋友，病人出院後要由她來照顧，詢問相關的醫療決策是否
可由她來負責

Plan
1. Keep Maxipime and Targocid
    Wait for sputum culture and blood culture result
2. F/U digestion, may restart NG milk if fair digestion
    If still fever, poor digestion or GI bleeding
    => May arrange abdominal CT for possible bowel perforation
    (previous CT image showed poor descending colon wall)
3.  Keep oral PPI
     F/u hemogram, component therapy if need
4. Keep iHD(SLED) QW2,4,6. Set DW as 65kg(or lower)
    Give albumin, F/u urine amount
    Consider to hold RRT if daily urine output increase
5. Keep contact with social worker, consult 倫理諮詢
6. Hold weaning due to unstable vital sign recently
