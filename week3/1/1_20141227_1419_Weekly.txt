Brief Summary of this week
After admission, CVVH was started on 11/25 for severe lactic acidosis.
Maxpime and metronidazole were given for Enterobacter bacteremia and
suspected left psoas muscle pyomyositis. His consciousness gradually became
clear and vasopressor was tapered.
   Radiologist was consulted on 11/26 for psoas abscess, while CT-guided
drainage was not feasible. CVVH was discontinued on 11/27 morning for
improved acidosis. Large amount of tarry stool was noted, and component
therapy was given. B/C (11/24 specimen) yielded Enterobacter aerogenes, and
S/C (11/24 specimen) yielded P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. So
Maxipime was not changed. Recurrent fever was noted on 11/27 evening, and
workup was repeated. SLED was started on 11/28 for fluid overload. NG
feeding with D5W was started on 11/29. Furosemide continuous infusion was
started on 11/29 for oliguria. However, poor response with fluid overload
still persisted. Cash albumin was given. CVVH was also started since 11/30,
but AK clots were noted frequently, so the CVVH was discontinued on 12/1,
and shifted back to SLED.
   Low grade fever with consciousness drowsy occurred again on 12/3. Under
the susepct of infection poor control, abdominal CT was arranged on 12/4
and it showed enlarged L't psoas muscle abscess size with suspect multiple
L't renal abscess. Antibiotic as upgraded to Tygacil and Fortum. We also
consulted radiologist again and pigtail was placed on 12/4. The blood
culture via CVC showed ampicillin resistant Enterococcus, so Vancomycin was
added. CVC was removed and a new one was placed. After there managements,
his fever seems subsided gradaully. The consciousness was also improved.
However, NG coffee ground was noted since 12/4. NPO with IV PPI were given.
We consulted GI man for EGD, but GI man thought that his condition was not
suitable for EGD(poor general condition with no family permit), so
conservative treatment was suggested first. His GI bleeding was improved
gradually under conservative treatment. NG feeding was restarted since
12/11.
   The final psoas muscle abscess culture revealed Enterobacter aerogenes.
We de-escalated antibiotic to Maxipime only according to drug sensitivity
test. However, low grade fever with consciounsess drowsy occurred since
12/10. Teicoplanin was added for GPC coverage. Paracentesis was done and
high LDH was noted during ascites study. The fever with consciousness
deterioration, poor digestion and abdominal distention occurred
subsequently. Antibiotic was upgraded to cravit and Invanz for broader
coverage. Brain CT on 12/18 showed no obvious ICH. However, abdominal CT on
12/18 disclosed suspicious descending colon perforation with
pneumoperitoneum and massive ascites. Diflucan was added. We consulted
general surgeon and they thought operation risk is too high, so operation
was not suggested. Then we consulted radiologist and two pigtails were
placed for dirty ascites drainage. Due to poor grave prognosis without
family support, we consulted palliative care team and they will cooperate
with us to conduct the end-of-life care including comfort care and even
withdrawal of life-sustaining support.
   After pigtail intra-abdominal abscess drainage and strong antibiotic,
the fever seems subsided gradually. However, new fever occurred again on
12/23. After discussing with ID specialist, antibiotic was upgraded to
Tygacil and Ceftazidime. The abdominal abscess culture disclosed candida
species(suspect fimetaria). High diflucan MIC was noted, so antifungal
agnet was shifted to anidulafungin. On 12/27 morning, anisocoria(pupil
size:L't > R't size) was noted. We will arrange emergent brain CT and keep
following up his condition.

ABP 122/47mmHg under levophed 5mcg/min
PCV: IP20  PEEP6  FiO2:0.35 => Tv:650, MV:10.4, SpO2 98%

Abd.CT(12/4): Suspected left iliopsoas abscess. Suspected left renal
abscess
=> iliopsoas abscess became larger compare to previous image
=> s/p small size pig-tail drainage due to limited safe margin, exchange a
larger one pigtail will be done on 12/5 afternoon
=> 12/5, 12/11, 12/15 Pigtail revision

Abd.CT(12/18): Descending colon perforation with pneumoperitoneum and
massive ascites
=> General surgeon: the operation is not feasible due to high risk!
=> CT-guided pig-tail(x2) insertion to abdominal cavity on 12/18

            anisocoria(pupil size:L't > R't size)

Chest: Bilateral coarse
Abdomen: softer, silent bowel sounds
Extremities: pitting edema 2+, ischemic changed over bilateral feet,
especially left toes

12/26 severe intradialysis hypotension, improved after increase levophed
and off UF, SLED 4hrs

Culture: S/C: PsA (S to Maxipime)

12/9 有一位女士(台大心理系教授
連韻文)表示是病人十多年的朋友，病人出院後要由她來照顧，詢問相關的醫療決策是否
可由她來負責
12/17 Neurologist: sepsis or critical illness related neuropathy related
con's change and general weakness were suspected, suggest arrange Brain EEG
and NCV
brian CT: Leukoaraiosis and brain atrophy
12/18 After discussing with 倫理諮詢 and Hospice team
        => 目前治療應以病患最大利益為主=> DNR 不電不壓
12/25 社工:會找民間見證人協助醫療代理人之簽署見證

Plan
1. Keep ABx as Tygacil+Fortum+Micafungin
    Wait for repeated ascites fungus culture
2. NPO with NG/anal tube decompression
    Keep pit-tail drainage for intra-abdominal abscess
3. TPN for nutritional support
4. Arrange emergent brain CT due to anisocoria
    If obvious ICH => May discuss with hospice team about withdrawl
5. Keep iHD(SLED) QW1,3,5. Set DW around 63kg
    Don't shift to CVVH due to terminal disease
    F/U renal function, urine output, ABG and electrolytes
6. Keep contact with social worker, 倫理諮詢, Hospice care
   => 目前治療應以病患最大利益為主=> 不電不壓
7. Informed patient's friends the grave prognosis
    Discuss with friends to generate one 醫療代理人!!
