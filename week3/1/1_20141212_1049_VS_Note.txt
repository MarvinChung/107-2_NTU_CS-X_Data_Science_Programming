Suggst:

-> remitent fever switch to full ventilator support
-> consult ethic committee for clarifying the decision making process of
medical care
-> Consciousness fluctuation
-> under very lower dose vasopressor guided by iCON
-> keep on RRT for decreased body water
-> fever peaking decreased
-> close montior abdominal condition, be aware of IAI
-> urine output increased
-> Left psoasa muscle abscess s/p pigtail drainage, after resivion, there
is no more drainage amount
-> broadspectrum antibiotic for coverage of IAI and cSSI
-> social worker still in search for searching possible next of kin for
decision making
-> inform his friend for critical conditon and poor prognosis
