Brief Summary of this week
This week, intermittent desaturation was noted. Followed CXR showed right
side penumothorax. Chest tube was inserted on 4/6, and saturation resumed
stable and iNO was tapered of on 4/8. However, AfRVR with exaggerated
fluctuated BP was noted. Amiodarone and Levophed were all given
intermittently for HR and BP. CV VS何奕倫 suggested adding Clonidine 0.5#
BID to control refractory AfRVR. However, poor digestion persisted. AfRVR
recurred as long as body temperature started to increase. On 4/9, we
arranged C+A+P CT for lung condition and also survey if there was other
infection focus. It showed bilateral lung GGOs. Viral pneumonitis was
favored. Thus, we kept Maxipime use only.
    Followed CXR showed right lung well expansion. Thus, we tried clamp the
chest tube on 4/10. However, desaturation was noted again. We opened the
chest tube and much air bubbles emerged.
    Keep medications to make the patient totally sedative to comply the
ventilator settings(low PEEP and high frequency). Watch out for CO2
retention and monitor chest tube function. Beware of left side pneumothorax
if desaturation.

Assessment
Maxipime 4/2-  D10

Ceftazidime 3/31-4/2, Tamiflu 3/25~4/1, Unasyn 3/26, Zithromax 3/26,
Targocid 4/2-4/4 , Avelox 3/27-4/8
prone position 3/27~3/30

<Current ventilator setting>
PCV  IP24 PEEP 6, RR 37, FiO2 55% -> Tv 365, MV 12.7, SPO2 98%, RR: 37

chest CT: no pneumothorax, well chest tube position
CO2 retension=> deep sedation, titrate up ventilator setting, inform family
the possibility of pneumothorax
NJ placement was done

3/27
PCR: influenza A; keep prone position due to high O2 demand
supine: FiO2 90% SaO2 108 PF ratio 120
prone: FiO2 70% SaO2 79.6 PF ratio 113
procalcitonin 1.792
Free T4 1.3, hsTSH  0.080
Influenza A+B PCR:Influenza A RNA ; positive, influenza B RNA (-)Chlamydiae
Antigen: negLegionella Urinary Ag: negMycoplasma Pneumoniae IgM positive
3/28 still fever
FiO2 tapered to 60% under prone position
PF 142.6 this morning
3/29  fever curve improved, CXR: bil consolidation but less
         P/F ratio 176 when prone and 150 when supine
3/30 PaO2 70 FiO2 35% after supine for 4 hours => no more prone
        poor digestion, no stool passage for 4 days, despite lactulose
enema
       suspected heavy sedative related, DC nimbex, taper fentanyl and
anxicam.
       low grade fever-> repeatseptic w/u
3/31 still constipation for 1 week => lactulose PO + R
CRP decreased to 6.5 ; poor digestion, suspect constipation related
4/1 try erythromycin for poor digestion
4/2 Ceftazidime was shifted to Maxipime, add Targocid for right neck CVC
use  → remove CVC
4/4 PF<200, prone was hold due to Af with RVR
4/7 Infection specialist 王振泰: favored viral pneumonitis, abx adjustment
is not necessary; consider shifting to Colistin if needed
4/8  VS何奕倫: suggest adding Clonidine 0.5# BID for refractory Af RVR
4/9 C+A+P CT: 1) Bilateral lung ground glass opacities, interlobular septal
thickening and consolidation. Etiology could be atypical infection.
2) Aortic aneurysm 3) Abnormal air in the liver, suspected pneumobilia
4/10  Clamp chest tube, and desaturation happens → open the chest tube and
much air bubbles emerged
          Still paroxysmal Af with RVR → high BP → amiodarone → BP dropped
→ Levophed → Af RVR again
          CV何奕惀: suggest taper amiodarone (taper rate) dosage if
unreliable digestion of clonidine; OR, give digoxin 0.25 amp QD and f/u
digoxin level on day 3

Plan
1. Keep cefepime use
2. Keep chest tube with low-pressure system drainage
3. Give 0.25 amp QD and f/u digoxin level on day 3 (4/13)
4. Keep low PEEP and high frequency due to CO2 retension
    Shift NJ diet to high fat diet
    Consider ECMO if refractory hypercapnia
5. Keep low-dose Levophed (2-5 cc/hr)
