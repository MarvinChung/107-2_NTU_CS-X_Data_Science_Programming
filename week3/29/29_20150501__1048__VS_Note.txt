Suggest:

-> Short run VT delvelop, under aggressive correct electrolyte imbalance,
consult CV man
-> taper support of ECMO by decreased FiO2 and bias flow
-> already consult GI man for liver function deteriorated
-> nutrition support via NJ tube
-> lung compliance gradual increased under lung protective ventilatory
strategy, taper down sedative for patient spontaneous breathing
-> Pseudomonas bacteremia, complete 14 antibiotics course
-> subclinical hyperthyroid, underl antithyroid drug, consult
endocrinologist
