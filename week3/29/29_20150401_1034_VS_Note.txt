Suggest:

-> O2 dmean improved, trial of PS weaning
-> switch to Precedex for bridging to weaning process
-> an episode of fever, adjust antibitocis
-> influenza A pneumonia under high dose Tamiflu
-> good response to Prone positioning, goal till PF ratio> 200 under supine
position, now under supine postion with stationary O2 demand
-> coverage of atypical pathogens
-> feeding poor, even after lactulose, trial of erythromycin infusion for
prokinetic
-> infrom family critical conditon and further treatment plan
