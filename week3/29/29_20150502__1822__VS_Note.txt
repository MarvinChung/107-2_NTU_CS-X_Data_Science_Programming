Suggest:

-> intermittent VPC, under aggressive correct electrolyte imbalance, CV man
suggest titrating dosage of IV xylocaine
-> taper support of ECMO by decreased FiO2 and bias flow
-> already consult GI man for liver function deteriorated
-> nutrition support via NJ tube
-> lung compliance gradual increased under lung protective ventilatory
strategy, taper down sedative for patient spontaneous breathing
-> be aware of VAP
-> subclinical hyperthyroid, underl antithyroid drug, consult
endocrinologist
-> influenza A pneumonia under high dose Tamiflu, completed
-> infrom family grave prognosis and further treatment plan
