Brief Summary of this week
Profound shock was noted on 4/19. After evaluation, ECMO was then
implanated. Abx was escalated to Colistin, Cravit, Targocid and Diflucan.
On 4/20, blood culture showed Pseudomonas(R to Cravit). Thus, we kept
Colistin and then deescalated to Ceftazidime since 4/24. Due to improved
hemodynamics, VA ECMO was removed on 4/21. However, bilirubin level kept
increasing. Abdominal echo showed no CBD or IHD dilatation. HBV and HCV
also showed negative result. Sepsis was more favored.
   Keep low tidal volume and high PEEP for lung recovery. Monitor I/O
balance. Watch out for electrolyte imbalance for possible exacerbating
digitalis toxicity.

Assessment
Ceftazidime with extended infusion (4/24-) D2
Colistin(4/20-4/24), Levoflaxacin (4/20-4/22)

<Current ventilator setting>
PCV IP 12 PEEP 10, RR 8, FiO2 40% -> Tv 84, MV 0.69, SPO2 93%

3/27
prone position due to high O2 demand
Influenza A RNA ; positive, influenza B RNA (-)
Mycoplasma Pneumoniae IgM positive
Chlamydiae Antigen: negLegionella Urinary Ag: neg
3/30 PaO2 70 FiO2 35% after supine for 4 hours => no more prone
4/1 try erythromycin for poor digestion
4/2 Ceftazidime was shifted to Maxipime, add Targocid for right neck CVC
use  → remove CVC
4/4 PF<200, prone was not performed due to Af with RVR
4/7 Infection specialist 王振泰: favored viral pneumonitis, abx adjustment
is not necessary; consider shifting to Colistin if needed
4/8  VS何奕倫: suggest adding Clonidine 0.5# BID for refractory Af RVR
4/9 C+A+P CT: 1) Bilateral lung ground glass opacities, interlobular septal
thickening and consolidation. Etiology could be atypical infection.
2) Aortic aneurysm 3) Abnormal air in the liver, suspected pneumobilia
4/10  Clamp chest tube, and desaturation happens → open the chest tube and
much air bubbles emerged
          Still paroxysmal Af with RVR → high BP → amiodarone → BP dropped
→ Levophed → Af RVR again
          CV何奕惀: suggest taper amiodarone (taper rate) dosage if
unreliable digestion of clonidine; OR, give digoxin 0.25 amp QD and f/u
digoxin level on day 3
4/13  S/C: Pseudomonas, all S
         Digoxin:0.23
         CV何奕惀: Keep digoxin 0.25amp QD and follow up digoxin on W3
                          Add amiodarone 200mg QD PO
4/14  TSH:0.007, fT4:2.19 → hyperthyroidism, add PTU 1# TID due to Inderal
is inappropriate now
         Procalcitonin 3.304
4/15  Adjust endotracheal tube position with exchanger, 26cm to 23cm, no
more leakage. Balloon: 10 cc.
         Remove right femoral CVC and insert right neck CVC.
         increase PTU dosage
         TA: 105.34 >14.4,  anti-TPO:(-), TSH receptor: (-), TBII:7.5(-)
         T3:<40, T4: 4.5
         VS 王治元: suggest tapering PTU to 2# TID, the patient was not
likely at thyroid storm status → follow TSH/fT4/T3/T4 QW
4/16  Add stress dose solu-cortef for relative adrenal insufficiency
4/19  profound shock
         => on V-A ECMO
         still poor oxygenation => on V-V ECMO
4/20  B/C: GNB
      Procalcitonin: 44.57
      Taper off Bosmin and Pitressin
4/21 Remove VA ECMO
4/23  fT4: 3.6, TSH: 0.065 => titrate up carbimazole to 1# TID


Plan
1. Give Ceftazidime for Pseudomonas bacteremia
2. Keep chest tube with low-pressure system drainage
    Monitor wound infection
3. Keep Carbimazole to 1# TID for hyperthyroidism
    Follow thyroid function QW1,4 and liver function more closely
4. Taper Solu-cortef to 50mg QD cIF
5. Keep VV ECMO. F/U ABG and lactate acid.
    Low tidal volumne for lung rest
6.Taper sedatives
    Monitor consciousness status
7. Keep K>4, Mg>1 for frequent VPCs
