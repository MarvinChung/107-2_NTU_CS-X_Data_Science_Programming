Brief Summary of this week
This week, high spiking fever up to 40'C was noted since 4/2, with
deteriorated respiratory pattern. Due to agitation, we titrated Fentanyl,
Anxicam and added Nimbex use. After consulting Infection specialist, we
kept Avelox and shifted Ceftazidime to Maxipime for better coverage of
E.coli. Targocid was also added for right neck CVC use. On 4/2, we removed
CVC for no indication. However, Af with RVR(up to 180 bpm) was noted on 4/3
night. After IV Herbesser and amiodarone infusion use, the HR decreased but
the BP also dropped. Levophed and Pitressin were added for low BP. Next
day, Pitressin was tapered off with Levophed 5cc/hr. Amiodarone IF was
again given due to increased HR up to 160 bpm.
About persistent fever and high ventilator demand, Infection specialist
favored influenza A-related. Thus, we kept current antibiotics use until
further evidence.
  We had informed the family the poor prognosis. CVVH might be indicated if
decreased U/O and further metabolic acidosis.


Assessment
Avelox 3/27-
Maxipime 4/2- for better coverage of E.coli
Targocid 4/2-  → DC it if no evidence of MRSA bacteremia

Ceftazidime 3/31-4/2, Tamiflu 3/25~4/1, Unasyn 3/26, Zithromax 3/26
prone position 3/27~3/30

<Current ventilator setting>
PCV  IP14 PEEP 10, RR 16, FiO2 85% -> Tv 400, SPO2 90-95%

Afib with RVR to 150-200 after CVC placement
s/p amiodarone 150mg, herbesser 20mg,HR decrease to 150-60
      Mg: 0.83 -> MgSO4 16 mEq, K: 3.8 -> KCl: 20mEq
      cardiac enzyme: WNL
on amiodarone contineous infusion

3/27
PCR: influenza A; keep prone position due to high O2 demand
supine: FiO2 90% SaO2 108 PF ratio 120
prone: FiO2 70% SaO2 79.6 PF ratio 113
procalcitonin 1.792
Free T4 1.3, hsTSH  0.080
Influenza A+B PCR:Influenza A RNA ; positive, influenza B RNA (-)Chlamydiae
Antigen: negLegionella Urinary Ag: negMycoplasma Pneumoniae IgM positive
3/28 still fever
FiO2 tapered to 60% under prone position
PF 142.6 this morning
3/29  fever curve improved, CXR: bil consolidation but less
         P/F ratio 176 when prone and 150 when supine
3/30 PaO2 70 FiO2 35% after supine for 4 hours => no more prone
        poor digestion, no stool passage for 4 days, despite lactulose
enema
       suspected heavy sedative related, DC nimbex, taper fentanyl and
anxicam.
       low grade fever-> repeatseptic w/u
3/31 still constipation for 1 week => lactulose PO + R
CRP decreased to 6.5 ; poor digestion, suspect constipation related
4/1 try erythromycin for poor digestion
4/2 Ceftazidime was shifted to Maxipime, add Targocid for right neck CVC
use  → remove CVC
4/3 Af with RVR → IV Herbesse, IF amiodarone → HR dropped with CO2
retention(possible Nimbex-related) →  Levophed+Pitressin use → Off
Pitressin on 4/4
4/4 Af with RVR again noted, up to 160 → IF amiodarone was given


Plan
1. Keep Avelox, Maxipime and DC Targocid for no MRSA evidence
2. Hold ventilator weaning; monitor daily PF ratio
    Conduct prone position if Afib with RVR subsides
3. Keep amiodarone infusion and asprin for Afib. Keep K~4.0, Mg~1.0.
4. Watch out U/O → if deteriorated renal function, consider CVVH(consent
was being signed)
5. Inform the family the poor prognosis
