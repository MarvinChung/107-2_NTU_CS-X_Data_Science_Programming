antibiotic adjustment and septic workup
-> O2 demand increased, CXR showed bilateral increased infiltration
-> workup of cardiac etiology, check cardiac enzyma, ECG and proBNP, no
evidence of decompensated CHF
-> influenza A pneumonia under high dose Tamiflu, completed
-> feeding fluctuation
-> infrom family critical conditon and further treatment plan
