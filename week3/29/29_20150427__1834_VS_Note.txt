Suggest:

-> liver function abnormality keeping deteriorated
-> nutrition support via NJ tube
-> vasopressor dosage decreased
-> poor lung compliance, consider whole body evulation
-> Poor lung compliance under lung protective ventilatory strategy
-> Pseudomonas bacteremia with septic shock under broadspectrum antibioitc,
complete 14 antibiotics course
-> under VV ECMO for lung support
-> subclinical hyperthyroid, underl antithyroid drug
-> influenza A pneumonia under high dose Tamiflu, completed
-> infrom family grave prognosis and further treatment plan
