Suggest:

-> remain on MOF in progression, vasopressor dosage decreased
-> poor lung compliance with Cst of 10
-> Poor lung compliance under lung protective ventilatory strategy
-> Pseudomonas bacteremia with septic shock under broadspectrum antibioitc
-> Switch to  VV ECMO for lung support
-> MOF in progression, esp liver function deterioration
-> subclinical hyperthyroid, underl antithyroid drug
-> influenza A pneumonia under high dose Tamiflu, completed
-> infrom family grave prognosis and further treatment plan
