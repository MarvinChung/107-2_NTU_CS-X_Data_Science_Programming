Brief Summary of this week
Her GCS went down to E1M2Vt this week. Babinski sign was positive. We
repeated CT on 8/24, and the report showed brain sweling, brain herniation
and probable ischemic change at right medial temporo-occipital lobe. WBC
elevation (8/26 11K -> 8/29 20K) was noted, but there was no fever. U/C on
8/19 grew Pseudomonas and U/A on 8/28 showed bacteria 3+, so we added
maxipime. We will discuss tracheostomy and further care with her family.

Assessment
[Treatment Course]
8/17 Craniotomy for tumor excision
8/18 Still M5, f/u MRI, try extubation
8/19 Bradycardia was noted in the afternoon. GCS:E1M4VT
8/21 slow M4
8/24 M2, Babinski(+), CT:brain edema
8/29 WBC:20K, no fever
     U/A bacteria 3+ -> add maxipime

2015/08/18 MRI With/Without Contrast--Brain (V1)
MRI of the brain without and with i.v. Gd chelate enhancement shows: 1.
Craniotomies at bilateral frontal regions. Parenchymal defect in right
posterior frontal lobe to external capsule; another defect in left middle
frontal lobe. Mild hemorrhage in the cavities. 2. Small ill-defined
enhancing areas posterior to right frontal cavity and also medioinferior to
the cavity, suggestive of residual tumors. 3. Ill-defined hyperintensities
on T2WI in left medial frontal and left upper anterior frontal, stationary
as compared with pre-op study. 4. Mild midline shift to left. 5.
Hyperintensities on FLAIR images in sulci, suggestive of mild subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
Multiple brain tumors, post-op, with residual tumors bilaterally.

2015/08/24 CT Without Contrast-Brain (V2)
Hx: GBM s/p Bifrontal craniotomy for tumor excision on 2015/08/17 Brain CT
without/with contrast enhancement shows: 1. Suboptimal study due to motion
artifacts. 2. Craniotomy change at bilateral frontal region. Post-operative
changes at right posterior frontal and left anterior tumors with fliud and
hematoma at operation beds and adjacent edema 3. Diffuse brain swelling,
mild midline shift to the left and right downward transtentorial herniation
4. Low density change at right medial temporo-occipital lobe, probably
ischemic change related to transtentorial herniation.
Post operative change at both frontal regions. Brain sweling, brain
herniation and probable ischemic change at right medial temporo-occipital
lobe

Plan
1. Check vital signs regularly
2. Check CVP level, Keep CVP level 8-10mmHg
3. Check GCS
4. Keep Maxipime
