Brief Summary of this week
The patient recieved craniotomy for tumor excision on 2015/08/17. After the
surgery, she was sent to SICU for further care. Her GCS score remained
E1VTM5 on 08/18. Follow-up MRI was done on POD 1, which showed small
residual tumors bilaterally. No post-op hemorrhage was noted. Slow response
to pain and bradycardia were noted at 5PM on 8/19. NE showed: pupil size
R/L=4/4.5 with slow reflex. 3% NaCl was given and her reflex improved at
10PM.
    However, her GCS score deteriorated to M4 on 2015/08/21 and then to
E1M2Vt on 2015/08/24 despite of medication. Babinski sign was positive
bilaterally. We repeated CT on 8/24, and the report showed brain sweling,
brain herniation and probable ischemic change at right medial temporo-
occipital lobe. WBC elevation (8/26 11K -> 8/29 20K) was noted without
fever. U/C on 8/19 grew Pseudomonas and U/A on 8/28 showed pyuria (WBC 10-
20) so we added maxipime.
  This week, we have explained the pros and cons about tracheostomy and
further care to her family. They signed DNR except for medication and they
refused to do tracheotomy. We consult hospice medical group for him. We
kept palliative treatment.
