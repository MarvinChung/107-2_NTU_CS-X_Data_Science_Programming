Brief Summary of this week
In this week, this patient recieved craniotomy for tumor excision on
2015/08/17. After the surgery, she was sent to SICU for further care. Her
GCS score was E1VTM5 on 08/18. Therefore, follow-up MRI was done and the
results showed: Multiple brain tumors, post-op, with residual tumors
bilaterally. Bradycardia was noted at 5PM on 8/19. NE showed: pupil size
R/L=4/4.5 with slow reflex. 3% NaCl was given and her reflex improved at
10PM.
However, her GCS score downdraded to M4 on 8/21.If her condition still
getting worse, we may arrange brain CT or MRI to survey whether she has
severe hydrocephalus, hemorrahge or other mass effects.

2015/08/18 MRI With/Without Contrast--Brain (V1)
MRI of the brain without and with i.v. Gd chelate enhancement shows: 1.
Craniotomies at bilateral frontal regions. Parenchymal defect in right
posterior frontal lobe to external capsule; another defect in left middle
frontal lobe. Mild hemorrhage in the cavities. 2. Small ill-defined
enhancing areas posterior to right frontal cavity and also medioinferior to
the cavity, suggestive of residual tumors. 3. Ill-defined hyperintensities
on T2WI in left medial frontal and left upper anterior frontal, stationary
as compared with pre-op study. 4. Mild midline shift to left. 5.
Hyperintensities on FLAIR images in sulci, suggestive of mild subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
Multiple brain tumors, post-op, with residual tumors bilaterally.


Plan
1. Post-OP care
2. Post-OP pain control
3. Prophylaxis abx
4. Check vital signs regularly
5. Keep SBP<140mmHg on postop day 1, then Keep SBP<160mmHg since day 2
6. Record daily drainage amount
7. Check CVP level, Keep CVP level 8-10mmHg
