## intermittent dropping flow during H/D (200ml/min was kept, but flow was
unstable)
--> may be dehydration or poor perm cath position
-->
1) hydration for 2 days and try H/D via perm-cath again on w6
2) re-do of perm-cath was discussed with CVS
   they told : longest perm-cath was used , severe hypotension noted during
IVG , poor cooperation of the patient
               no more operation will be done
