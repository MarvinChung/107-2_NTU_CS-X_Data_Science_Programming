<Treatment course>
   After admission, Augmentin was administered from 12/23 to 12/28 for left
calf cellulitis and right 1st toe gangrene with pus discharge. However, the
extent of erythema improved little. Discharge also appeared in left 1st toe
on 12/25. Consulted dermatologist suggested changing dressing with fucidin
first instead of nail extraction at this time. On 12/28, pus culture
reported Enterbacter aeruginosa, likely amp-C strain. Thus cefepime was
used instead. As for the revascularization, PTA to right side was performed
on 12/25 and to left side on 12/30. The results were good with increased
bilateral ATA pulses. Another problem was the left AVF thrombosis,
mandating hemodialysis via right femoral DLC. Vascular duplex of the AVF
was done on 12/31 and showed total thrombosis. The DLC also dislodged in
12/30 night. A new one was inserted on 1/1. We has been taking BP from
right arm but the SBPs were around only 80-100. It was probably confounded
by right subclavian artery stenosis. His vital sign was stable without
resucitation.
    We consulted PS for left toe nail extraction on 1/2. His cellulitis and
wound got improvement gradully. We was told by the care giver that the
patient had dysarthria and intermittent drooling. After NE evaluation, mild
stroke of brain stem could not be ruled out. MRI was not indicated due to
pacemaker. We then kept conservative treatment with plavix for him.
Coumadin was also indicated due to high CHAD score but he got sool OB 4+
and we hold it. P&R was also consulted for swallowing evaluation. His
swallowing reflex was intact but oral intake amount was impaired by
dementia. NG was indicated and the family finally received NG placement on
1/9.
    On 1/8, Perm-cath under IVG was done and intra-operation hypotension
was noted despie levophed use. However, intermittent drop flow during H/D
(200ml/min was kept, but flow was unstable). It may be related to
dehydration or poor perm cath position. Hospice was consulted and after
family meeting. His key person prefer not to H/D but they still await the
reply from other family member in the America.

<Plan>
1. keep maxipime for celllitis, may D/C
   keep better iodine use of the wound
   add fucidin for left calf cellulitis
2. keep plavix, hold coumadin due to stool OB 4+
3. NG placement today
4. for poor perm-cath function :
1) hydration for 2 days and try H/D via perm-cath again on w6
2) re-do of perm-cath was discussed with CVS
   they told : longest perm-cath was used , severe hypotension noted during
IVG , poor cooperation of the patient
               no more operation will be done
