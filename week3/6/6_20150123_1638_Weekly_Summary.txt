<Treatment course>
   After admission, Augmentin was administered from 12/23 to 12/28 for left
calf cellulitis and right 1st toe gangrene with pus discharge. However, the
extent of erythema improved little. Discharge also appeared in left 1st toe
on 12/25. Consulted dermatologist suggested changing dressing with fucidin
first instead of nail extraction at this time. On 12/28, pus culture
reported Enterbacter aeruginosa, likely amp-C strain. Thus cefepime was
used instead. As for the revascularization, PTA to right side was performed
on 12/25 and to left side on 12/30. The results were good with increased
bilateral ATA pulses. Another problem was the left AVF thrombosis,
mandating hemodialysis via right femoral DLC. Vascular duplex of the AVF
was done on 12/31 and showed total thrombosis. The DLC also dislodged in
12/30 night. A new one was inserted on 1/1. We has been taking BP from
right arm but the SBPs were around only 80-100. It was probably confounded
by right subclavian artery stenosis. His vital sign was stable without
resucitation.
    We consulted PS for left toe nail extraction on 1/2. His cellulitis and
wound got improvement gradully. We was told by the care giver that the
patient had dysarthria and intermittent drooling. After NE evaluation, mild
stroke of brain stem could not be ruled out. MRI was not indicated due to
pacemaker. We then kept conservative treatment with plavix for him.
Coumadin was also indicated due to high CHAD score but he got sool OB 4+
and we hold it. P&R was also consulted for swallowing evaluation. His
swallowing reflex was intact but oral intake amount was impaired by
dementia. NG was indicated and the family finally received NG placement on
1/9.
    On 1/8, Perm-cath under IVG was done and intra-operation hypotension
was noted despie levophed use. However, intermittent drop flow during H/D
(200ml/min was kept, but flow was unstable). Hospice was consulted and
after family meeting, they signed the DNR but still hesitated about H/D.
    After pre-H/D midodrine use, H/D could be done via perm-cath with flow
~200ml/min and without water removal. We then D/C cefepime on 1/14.
However, he had increased sputum but no desaturation noted then. Follow-up
CXR showed RUL/RML pneumonia on 1/14. Tazocin was added for aspiration
pneumonia. Later was switched to meropenem due to worsen respiratory
pattenr and O2 saturation. Stool pus cell also showed positive, and due to
prolonged use of ABx, we added oral metronidazole for him to cover
clostridium infection. Poor prognosis was informed to the family and they
could realize the condition.
    On 1/16, his BP dropped again during H/D. After family meeting with
nephrologist, the family decided not to H/D anymore. Hospice care was
choosed then. We then kept morphin use or his dyspnea and pain.


<Plan>
1. keep Mepem
2. DNR 全拒院宣 , no H/D , 土葬(不需移除ICD)
3. keep cordarone 1# QD , D/C Hebesser
4. hospice care
