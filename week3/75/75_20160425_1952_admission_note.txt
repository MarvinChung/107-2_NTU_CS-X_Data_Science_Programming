This 57 year old male, had past history of:
1. Infective endocarditis, Streptococcus viridans related, with mitral valve and aortic valve involvement, complicated with severe mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, status post double porcine valve replacement on 2016/02/13(義大醫院)
2. Heart failure, valvular heart related, HYNA Fc III, LVEF 34.6% (2016/03/16)
3. Indirect hyperbilirubinemia, suspect MAHA related
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, CHADS2 score 2
5. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlaping syndrome
6. Hypertension
7. Osteopenia, T score -1.6
8. Benign prostate hypertrophy
9. Adrenal insufficiency, iatrogenic
10. Glucose intolerance, HbA1c 6.4% (2016/02/12)

He was a non-smoker and drank minimal amount of alcohol regularly. His childrens also had asthma. Per the patient, he had intermittent asthma attack since 40-year-old. He took steroid, antihistamine, and inhalation pMDI as needed for symptom control. He had spontaneous rib fracture after severe cough and had a episode of traumatic right femoral fracture 9 years ago, status post ORIF. Osteoprosis was found which was probably related to steroid. His ADL was independent and he lives with his family. He had left mandibular cellulitis and was admitted to 高醫 for half month. Incision and drainage was performed. It was related to caries or pulpitis, and he received dental implant around July/Auguest in 2011. He reported persistent wheezing since about 2012. For symptom control, he took prednisolone 8mg per day regularly. He did not have body weight loss or gain, leg edema, or orthopnea during that time.
He had tooth scaling and crown repair in November, 2015. No invasive procedure was performed. He then had persistent low grade fever 37.5-38.5 without chills in December, 2015. His weight lost from 76 kg to 71 kg within one month. There was no cough, dysuria, abdominal pain, or skin rash. His appetite was as usual. He visited 屏東基督教 hospital and survey for TB and Legionella were negative. He was referred to ID OPD and took unknown antibiotics. The fever subsided. Then, he found left leg edema in late December in 2015,but it recovered soon. The patient reported decreased daily activity since late January in 2016. He could not climb upstair initially and he could not walk for short distance later. He also found bilateral leg swelling and wheezing during respiratory. There was no PND or orthopnea. His body weight was about 73 kg, which was similar to previous body weight. He visited 屏東基督教 hospital and was treat as ACS attack with inhaled bronchodilator. However, his symptoms got progression and he had PND and orthopnea in early Feburary, 2016. Due to above symptoms, he visited 義大 hospital on 2016/02/09 with initial vital signs T/P/R 36.4/127/24, BP 155/59 mmHg, SpO2 90% (room air). He was treated as ADHF and NSTEMI (due to mild elevation of TnI 0.204). CXR showed cardiomegaly and lung edema. UCG on 02/11 showed vegetation at MV and AV with severe MR and moderate AR. Blood culture yielded Strep. viridans (wild type). He was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin since 02/11. Due to respiratory distress, he was intubated on 02/12 and received double valve replacement(AVR+MVR) on 02/13. Tissue valve was used. He had shock, AKI s/p CVVH, and acute liver failure in ICU and he was extubation on 02/18. Gentamicin was discontinued in 02/15 and meropenem was added. He had new fever on 03/04 and sputum culture yielded MRSA. Solu-medrol was given for suspicious adrenal insufficiency. Antibiotics was shifted to Tienam and ampicillin. However, the patient still had leg edema and DOE. UCG on 3/04 showed LVEF 67%, s/p AVR & MVR without vegetation or myocardial abscess, small pericardial effusion, mild MR/TR. Due to unresolved sympotms, he was referred to NTUH. During 3/15-3/23, we consulted cardiologist and adjusted diuretics and antiarrhythmics agents. UCG was done on 3/16 and found LVEF 34.6%, TRPG 29.8, moderate AR, mild MR, and mild-moderate TR without evidence of residual endocarditis. Twenty-hour Holter showed no supraventricular or ventricular ectopy. One episode of atrial fibrillation was found. Abdominal ultrasound was arranged due to abnormal liver enzyme and found parenchymal liver disease, Hepatic cyst (S2), GB stone and sludge, left renal cyst, and pleural effusion (right>left). We also arranged vascular Duplex due to right leg swelling and decrease pulsation at right dorsalis pedis. It showed patent artery flow and venous flow. His dyspnea and leg edema improved after diuretics use. Since no pathogen was isolated, ceftriaxone was discontinued after a 7-day course. He was discharged and will returned to our OPD.

  After discharge, he had no discomfort until 3 days ago. After he visited cardiologist at 2016/04/21, he tapered night time predonine from 1# to 0.5#. However, he developed general weakness since 4/23. Head fullness with high fever to 39.8C was noted since 4/24. He also had mild cough, poor appetite, and decreased urine output in these 2 days. But he denied rhinorrhea, sore throat and chest tightness. He had been to 義大醫院at 4/24, and  high inflammation marker was noted. He contacted with the NTUH cardiologist, and was transferred to NTUH for further management.
