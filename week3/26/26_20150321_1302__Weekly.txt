Brief Summary of this week
The right AK wound did not heal well, but there was no pus discharge.
Bloody stool was noted on 3/16, subsided once. However, massive bloody
stool was found on 3/17. Component therapy was given and transamin was
prescribed. Lab data showed anemia and impaired liver/renal function, but
there was no coagulopathy. It stopped after treatment. We arranged CFS for
further evaluation, but failed due to poor colon preparation. Repeated CFS
on 3/19 revealed A-colon colitis and S-colon polyp, s/p A-colon biopsy.
Abdominal echo for impaired liver function showed fatty liver and chronic
cholecystitis. We keep Rocephin use for occult infection. The right AK
wound did not heal and we removed partial suture and applied wet dressing
Q8H.
Massive bloody stool was noted again on 3/20 with hypovolemic shock. Fluid
challenge and component therapy were given. We inserted one femoral CVC for
better resuscitation. His blood pressure improved. Right side gaze and left
hemiparalysis were noted. Further brain CT was arranged and showed right
parietal-occipital infarction. After adequate fluid challenge, his muscle
power improved. Bosmin gauze was applied for his LGI bleeding. But huge
amount of bloody stool was noted on 3/21. We contacted with GI man who
performed CFS and he suggested CT for further diagnosis. A+P CT showed
active bleeding at rectum. Therefore, TAE was arranged and applied to right
suprerior and inferior rectal artery. Post-TAE condition was fair and
bloody stool improved gradually. Regurgitation was noted and NG
decompression showed bile material.
