Brief Summary of this week
His right AK wound still had necrotic debris under wet dressing Q8H. We
contacted with plastic surgeon and he then arranged surgery on 3/5.
Debridement and partial sequestrectomy were performed smoothly. Hemovac was
set for drainage, but the amount was few. After one week, we removed the
hemovac and there is no obvious pus discharge noted. We downgraded
antibiotic to Unasyn and he was afebrile. The WBC level was around 10K-13K,
and CRP level was decreasing. Series CXR showed improved lung parenchyma.
However, elevated liver function was noted. We will arrange abdominal echo
for further evaluation.
