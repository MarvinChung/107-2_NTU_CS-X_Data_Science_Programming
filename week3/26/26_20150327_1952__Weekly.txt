Brief Summary of this week
His GI bleeding improved after TAE. We found low Hb during follow-up blood
sampling. We checked DIC profile and it was positive. Therefore, platelet,
FFP, and cryoprecipitate were given. We arranged family meeting on 3/24 and
further treatment plan was confirmed. Due to ACKD, hemodialysis was started
on 3/25. Then, we will arrange PTA and then further debridement.
