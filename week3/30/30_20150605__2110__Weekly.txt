noted since 2015/5/4.
2. Metastatic gastric cancer, adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, Borrmann
type III, moderately differentiated, with liver metastasis, stage IV, non-
resectable, cT4N2M1, HER2/Neu 3+/3+ with increasing Ki-67 activity, p53
negative, status post palliative chemotherapy cisplatin + capecitabine (IV)
(2013/5/28-2013/7/30), progressive disease, status post phase II/III study
with TDM1 (VIII) (2013/8/30-2014/1/24), partial response (PR) then later
with progressive disease (PD), status post LJM716+ Herceptin (VIII)
(2014/2/25-2014/9/30), partial response (PR) then PD later, under ASLAN001
plus Cisplatin and Capecitabine (VI, 2014/10/22~ 2015/03/11), with

<Treatment course>
    After admission, we consulted radiologist, and PTCD placement was
performed on 2015/05/14. Follow-up lab data on 2015/05/18 revealed decline
of t-bil level (11.45->7.85). Anemia was also noted, and cash oral Nexium
was prescribed. Family meeting was arranged on 2015/5/20, and terminal
status was informed. Hospice concept was introduced, and they agreed with
palliative care. Home TPN training was also arranged for poor oral intake.
    On 6/3, follow up abdominal standing X ray showed increased bowel gas
with dilatation of bowel loops in the abdomen, r/o ileus. Primperan and
Bisacodyl were prescribed and increased dose. On 6/4, hematemesis was noted
several times since the morning. Blood transfusion with PRBC 2U+FFP 6U and
Vitamin K-1 plus transamine were prescribed. Emergent upper GI panendoscopy
was arranged however was hold due to severe INR prolongation (INR: 4.12).
The patient's hematemesis received gradually. On 6/5, the patient received
upper GI panendoscopy, which showed:
(1) Gastric ulcer, several, AW of the upper body. (2)Suspicious gastric
tumor, LC of the middle body. (3) Gastric tumor with narrowed pyloric ring,
PW of the antrum. (4) Incomplete study. Due to large amount of blood clot
with abdominal fullness, NG tube insertion was performed.

<Assessment>
Nutrition: minimal oral intake with TPN (Nutriflex 1000 mL)
           -> home TPN training completed

2015/05/14 PTCD  daily bile drainage amount: around 100-250mL

2015/5/1 C+A+P CT: gastric cancer with enlarged abdominal lymphadenopathy,
liver and right adrenal metastases. Biliary dilatation

2015/5/5 Upper GI panendoscopy:

<Plan>
1. Keep Vitamin K-1 weekly and transamine
2. If lots amount of hematemesis -> consider consult radiologist for TAE
(Currently the patient's family still didn't signed the DNR)
3. Record NG decompression amount.
4. Record PTCD drainage amount and character.
5. Nutrition support with TPN
6. Supportive care, pending family's DNR result.
7. Keep primperan Q8H, give Bisacodyl 2# Q8H
8. NPO, avoid any food or water intake.
9. Follow up CBC and PT/aPTT tomorrow morning and next W1
