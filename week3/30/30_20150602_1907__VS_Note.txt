gastric cancer liver mets with obstructive jaundice s/p PTCD
abdominal distension seemed worse in these 2 days
no much improvement after Dulcolax suppository use

plan:
1. regular prokinetic use
2. take a standing abdomen tomorrow
3. if worse or air-fluid level(+), consider NG decompression
   (I've already informed family of my plan)
