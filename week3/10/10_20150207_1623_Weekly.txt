Brief Summary of this week
The culture of sputum on 01/24 showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pleural
effusion showed E.coli and Enterococcus gallinarum (VRE). The culture of
pleural effusion on 01/27 showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus
faecium, Enterococcus casseliflavus (VRE), Candida albicans, and Candida
tropicalis. The culture of pleural effusion from chest tube on 01/30 showed
Candida tropicalis, and the culture from right subphrenic drain showed
Enterococcus faecium and Candida tropicalis.
     Only mild drainage was noted in the right chest tube. After discussing
with the chest surgeon on 02/04, right pleural irrigation with normal
saline 1000 ml BID was performed. Atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response happened intermittently, so Cordarone was shifted to
IV form on 02/06. Low-grade fever was noted since 02/04. Porlong PT and
hypoalbuminemia were noted, so Vitamine K1 and albumin were given.
Hyperbilirubinemia was also noted, suspected TPN or liver decompensation
related.

[PE]
E1VtM4
HEENT: conjunctiva: no pale, sclera: icteric

Extremity: dry

[Ventilator settings]

[Important images and studies]
1/28 Pathology
(1) Intestine and colon: inflammation and necrosis
(2) LN and appendix: no evidence of metastasis

[Recent culture]
1/16 blood: (-) x 2
1/24 S/C:PsA 2+
1/24 Pleural effusion: E.coli few (S to 3rd cefa and quinolone, S to
carbapenam), Enterococcus gallinarum few(VRE)
1/27 S/C:neg
1/27 Pleural effusion: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2+, Enterococcus faecium 3+,
Enterococcus casseliflavus 3+ (VRE),
     Fungus culture: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis
       => MIC of Candida tropicalis: 0.50
1/30 Right subphrenic rubber drain culture: enterococcus faecium 1+,
Candida tropicalis 2+
     Right chest tube: Candida tropicalis few
2/2  Right subphrenic rubber drain culture: Candida tropicalis 1+

[Important consultations and family's decision]
1/26 Consult CS for empyema, arrange VATS
1/28 GS: due to proximity of ileostomy to lower portion of laparotomy
wound, high likelihood of wound/fascia infection, keep laparotomy wound
open to allow open drainage and prevent subcutaneous abscess formation
1/26 family signed DNR except medication, refuse hemodialysis
2/02 ID: shift Diflucan to Anidulafungin due to liver function deteriorated
under Diflucan and persistent fever
2/04 CS: suggest right pleural irrigation with N/S 1000 ml BID.
2/5 CS: suggest follow up CXR QD and keep irrigation
2/6 ID: If fever with hypotension or leukocytosis, change Mepem and
ampicillin to Tatumcef and Tigecycline.

[Important interventions and new added medication]
1/24 desaturation, s/p thoracentesis, paracentesis, shock, ETT+MV,
Mepem+Targocid
1/27 VATS: fecal materal in right pleural cavity, s/p drainage and chest
tube insertion;
--> consulted GS for exploratory laparotomy: necrotic tissue at post-RFA
liver, a 3x3cm perforation at colon hepatic flexure, with focal abscess
formation due to severe peri-hepatic adhesions, no apparent diaphragm
rupture found, s/p right hemicolectomy and end-ileostomy
2/04 Shift PCV to PSV
2/7 Porlong PT, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia
    => add Vit.K1 and Albumin


Plan
1. Keep Mepem, ampicillin, and Anidulafungin for empyema, monitor fever
curve; repeat septic workup today, pursue culture results.
2. ID: If fever with hypotension or leukocytosis, change Mepem and
ampicillin to Tatumcef and Tigecycline.
3. Keep ventilator support and taper sedation agents
4. Keep I/O balance
5. Keep NPO and TPN support due to colon perforation; Continue open
drainage for lower laparotomy wound.
6. Right pleural irrigation with N/S 1000 ml BID as the CS doctor
suggested.
7. Keep Cordarone for Af-RVR.
8. DNR except medication; family refuse hemodialysis
9. Vit.K1 and Albumin for porlong PT and hypoalbuminemia.
10. Contact with GI doctor VS陳健弘 for Baraclude (since next W3)
