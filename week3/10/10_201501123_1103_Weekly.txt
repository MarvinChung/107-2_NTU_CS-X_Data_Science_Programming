Brief Summary of this week
ECG showed tachycardia (HR > 180 /min) with atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter on 01/16 and 01/17, so Cordaron infusion with herbesser was given
as the CV specialist suggested. RUQ persisted with urinary retention on
01/17. Urethral stricture was noted, so Foley catheter insertion could not
be done. Regualr urine catheterization was performed as the urologist
suggested on 01/17 under the impression of Tramal-related urinary
retention. RUQ pain with epigatralgia was still complained, so NPO was kept
and self-paid IV form Nexium was given on 01/17. The report of CT on 01/16
showed mild wall thickening with small air pockets at hepatic flexure of
colon, suspected post-RFA inflammation or microperforation. Fever subsided
gradually on 01/18. Metronidazole was added on 01/19 for anaerobic pathogen
coverage. Delirium was noted on 01/19.
     Tachycardia with atrial fibrillation was subsided gradually, so
Cordaron infusion was discontinued on 01/20. Desaturation with SpO2 88% was
noted in 01/20 morning, so O2 nasal cannula was use. The chest X-ray showed
right pleural effusion, but right thoracentesis was not performed due to
abdominal pain with agitation during bedside echo examination. O2 mask was
used for increasing O2 demand on 01/21. KUB and decubitus abdomen X-ray was
checked on 01/21, which showed dilated bowel without significant free air.
Ileus was suspected, and bowel perforation was not favored by the
radiologist. O2 demand decreased on 01/22, so O2 mask was shifted back to
nasal cannula.


Assessment
Metronidazole (01/19~) D5
Rocephine (01/16~) D8
Baraclude (cash)

1. RUQ pain, but abdomen became softer.

No fever
SpO2: 95% (N/C 5L)
Consciousness: E4V5M6, but delirium sometimes
Conjunctiva: not pale, sclera: anicteric
Breath sound: clear
Abdomen: muscle guarded but softer, tenderness over the RUQ area.
EXT: pitting edema. 1+, over bilateral legs.

(2014/11/28) MRI:
       Three nodules of low signal on T1WI and high signal on T2WI at S8
(9mm and 1.7cm) and S6 surface (1.6cm), suspected recurrent HCCs.

(2015/01/16) Chest and Abdomen CT:
1.HCC S/P extended left hepatectomy and cholecystectomy.
2.Multiple Post-TAE+RFA effect in right hepatic lobe.
3.No definite tumor recurrence in the remnant liver.
4.No definite liver abscess.
5.Mild wall thickening with small air pockets at hepatic flexure of colon,
Post-RFA inflammation or microperforation is suspected. suggest clinical
correlation and F/U.
6.Mild ascites.
7.Atrophy of left kidney.
8.Mild pericardial effusion.
9.Mild bil pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis, more on right side.

(2015/01/20)
CXR: right pleural effusion.

(2015/01/21) KUB and decubitus abdomen X-ray:
1. Increased bowel gas with dilatation of bowel loops in the abdomen,
suspected ileus
2. Focal increased radiolucency in right abdomen, dilated bowel loops or
free air should be differentiated.


Plan
1. Keep Rocephin and Metronidazole, pursue B/C results.
2. Pain control with Tramal IF.
3. Keep NPO with PPN, resumed diet if abdominal pain subsided .
4. Regualr urine catheterization if needed.
5. Keep Herbesser for rate control.
6. Consider right thoracentesis if desaturation and dyspnea progressing.
7. Consider standing abdomen X-ray (if the pain relieved) or non-contrast
abdominal CT to r/o bowel perforation, if abdomen pain progressing.
