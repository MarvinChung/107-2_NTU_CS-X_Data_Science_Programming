2015/01/16 CT With/Without Contrast-Abdomen (V1)
Abdomen CT without/with enhancement showed 1.HCC S/P extended left
hepatectomy and cholecystectomy. 2.Multiple Post-TAE+RFA effect in right
hepatic lobe. 3.No definite tumor recurrence in the remnant liver in 4-
phasic enhancement study. 4.No definite liver abscess. 5.Patent PV. 6.Mild
wall thickening with small air pockets at hepatic flexure of colon, Post-
RFA inflammation or microperforation is suspected. suggest clinical
correlation and F/U. 7.no definite pneumoperitoneum. 8.Mild ascites.
9.Atrophy of left kidney. 10.Bil. renal small cysts. 11.No definite lesion
in spleen, pancreas, and bil. adrenal glands. 12.No definite paraaortic
LAP. 13.Mild pericardial effusion. 14.Mild bil pleural effusion with
bibasilar atelectasis, more on right side.

2015/01/16 CT With/Without Contrast-Chest (V1)
CT of chest without and with iv contrast shows: 1. bilateral pleural
effusion more on right. atherosclerotic change of aorta. pericardial
effusion 2. fibrocalcified lesions at bilateral lungs. interlobular
thickening at bilateral lungs. linear atelectasis at bilateral lower lungs.
engorged vasculature at RLL (SE5/IM86-91). tiny faint opacity or nodule in
RLL (5/91). bronchiectasis in LLL. also suggest correlate with abdominal CT
report.
bilateral pleural effusion. interstitial change, linear atelectasis at
bilateral lungs. bronchiectasis in left lung. RLL faint nodule or opacity
with nonspecific appearance. please also refer to text for details.

A: The findings in chest and abdominal CT might be due to the side effects
of RFA. Colon micorperforation could not be ruled out.

P:
1. continue antibiotics
2. keep close monitoring
