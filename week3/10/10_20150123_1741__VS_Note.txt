A: The peritoneal sign is less evident. His O2 demand decreases. His
delirium improves. These indicate that his condition is improving. KUB and
left decubitus KUB show no definite free air. However, radiologist cannot
completely rule out the presence of free air. Radiologist suggests non-
contrast for further evaluation.

P:
1. keep present managment
2. arrange non-contrast abdominal CT
