Brief Summary of this week
After admission, hypertensive urgency (BP 219/97 mmHg) with headache under
Zanidip. Captopril was given once, and the dosage of Zanidip was increased.
The Pre-RFA TAE was performed on 2015/01/12. Hypertension with SBP over 180
mmHg was still noted in 01/12 night, so Apresoline was added. Chest
tightness was alson noted in 01/12, and ECG showed no ST-T change. Cardiac
enzymes were not elevated. Hypertensive urgency with headache was improved
gradually.
     The CT-guide RFA was done on 2015/01/14 smoothly, and NPO was
performed for 1 day after RFA due to close distance between ablation zone
and adjacent colon. The total bilirubin level on 01/15 was 3.40 mg/dL, and
AST/ALT was 1193/911 U/L, so discharge was held. No abdominal pain was
noted, so diet was resumed gradually on 01/15. An episode of fever up to
38.9 degree Celsius happened in 01/15 evening without discomfort.
     However, epigatralgic and RUQ pain with severe tenderness was noted in
01/16 afternoon. Peritoneal sign was positive. Tachypnea with cold sweating
was also noted. Breath sound was clear, but disorientation was noted. ECG
showed tachycardia with suspected PSVT. The blood gas showed respiratory
alkalosis (pH 7.408, PCO2 27.8, HCO3 17.7) and lactic acid was 3.40 mmol/L.
WBC was 19.53 K/μL. Tramal for pain control was given. Abdominal echo
showed no internal hemorrhage, no free air, and no ascites. Due to the
persistent pain, NPO was performed. Low grade fever was noted, so Rocephin
was added for empirical use. Emergent chest and abdominal CT was arranged.


Assessment
Rocephine (01/16~) D1

1. Severe RUQ pain this afternoon.

Fever 38.9'C last night, low-grade fever today.
Consciousness: clear but disorientation intermittently
Conjunctiva: not pale, sclera: anicteric
Breath sound: clear
Abdomen: muscle guarded, hypoactive bowel sound, tenderness and rebound
tenderness over the RUQ area.
EXT: no pitting edema.

(2014/11/28) MRI:
       Three nodules of low signal on T1WI and high signal on T2WI at S8
(9mm and 1.7cm) and S6 surface (1.6cm), suspected recurrent HCCs.

(2015/01/12) Pre-RFA TAE:
      Multiple small HCCs in right hepatic lobe, S/P Pre-RFA TAE
localization.

Plan
1. Keep Rocephin, pursue culture results.
2. Pending for the chest + abdominal CT.
3. Pain control with Tramal IF.
4. F/U LFT and T-bil.
5. Keep Zanidip for hypertension.
6. Keep NPO, resumed diet if abdominal pain subsided with negative finding
in CT.
7. F/U cardiac enzymes and ECG in 01/16 night.
