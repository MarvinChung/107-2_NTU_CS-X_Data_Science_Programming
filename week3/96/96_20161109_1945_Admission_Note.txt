病史(Brief History) 
{Present Illness}
The patient is a 80-year-old gentleman, with the medical history of glaucoma under regular follow-up at CGMH, and hypertension with unspecified medical history, although usage of Olmetec was provided. He had independent ADLs/IADLs, and was said to be able to climb stairs for 1-2 flights before feeling dyspnic. There was no known orthopnea or nocturnal dyspnea, but decubitus position was often observed during sleep. He had no history of stroke and there was no family history of stroke, although a brother has a history of premature death. He was last seen to be normal at around 18:45 in the evening of 11/8. When he was next seen by his son at around 7:30 today, he was seen laying on the floor and was not responseive to stimulations. Tachypnea was also noted. He was thus sent to our ED. Vital signs at arrival was blood pressure 253/109 mmHg, pulse rate: 83/min, respiratory rate: 16/min. Due to poor conscious, he was intubated. CT without contrast revealed a 15-18 ml pontine hemorrhage. CXR revealed bilateral increased infiltration of the lung fields with cardiomegaly, along with suspected Kerley B lines. His family denied him to have recent fever, URI/UTI/diarrhea symptoms, or body weight loss. Neurosurgeon was consulted, but surgical intervention was deemed to be not feasible, with poor prognosis informed. He was admitted for further management and evaluation.
