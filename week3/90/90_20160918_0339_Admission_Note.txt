病史(Brief History) 
<Present Illness>
    This 35-year-old male has the history of:
1. Non-small-cell-lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, with malignant pleural effusion, T2aN0M1a, stage IV, with EGFR exon 19 deletion, T790M mutation (+), ALK(-), status post Tarceva during 2014/02/20~2015/02/22; Disease progression with left supraclavicular, left hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, status post lung CT guided re-biopsy, status post clinical trial of EGF816 (nivolumab, 2015/03/10~2015/12/16); Disease progression with bilateral axilla lymphadenopathy, status post left axillary lymph node excisional biopsy on 2015/12/19, with EGFR exon 19 deletion without T790M, Met FISH (-), status post TATTON trial (AZD9291 + AZD6244, omisertinib 80mg 1# QD + selumetinib 75mg 1# Q12H, 4days on-3days off, C1D1=2016/01/22, C2D1=2016/02/19, C3D1=2016/03/18, C4D1=2016/04/15, C5D1=2016/05/13); Disease progression with larger lung and chest wall metastases, status post port-A implantation on 2016/06/21, status post Alimta + Cisplatin (C1D1=2016/06/10, C2D1=2016/06/30, C3D1=2016/07/21, C4D1=2016/08/11); Disease progression with larger lung and chest wall metastases and new metastasis in left frontal lobe, status post Taxotere (C1D1=2016/09/01), Disease progression with multiple brain metastases and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
2. Intermittent atrial premature beat
 
    His baseline status prior this admission was clear consciousness (GCS: E4M6V5), good orientation, total independent with his daily activities, free from nasogastric tube, foley catheter, and diaper, could eat by himself without chocking, and lived at home by himself. He had regular follow-ups at Dr. 余忠仁's clinic for his lung cancer.
    He has smoked 1/4 PPD for the past 7 years. Initially, he noted left chest pain in 2013/10 when he was sneezing and coughing during a common cold. The location of the pain ranged from just below his left scapula horizontally to the same level of anterior left chest. The pain was intermittent, and the patient could not identify any exacerbating or relieving factor (i.e. it was unrelated to inspiration or expiration) except that it seemed to get better when he was supine. Progressive dyspnea developed so he was brought to 仁愛 hospital, where chest X-ray showed massive left pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis showed bloody fluid and cytology was positive for malignant cells that were E-cadherin (+), CEA (+), TTF-1 (+), favoring metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Chest CT was not informative due to massive pleural effusion. 
    He visited Dr. 余忠仁's clinic on 2014/02/13, while chest X-ray showed left pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis drained 1000ml of fluid that contained 5.3 g/dl total protein, 562 U/L LDH, 82 mg/dl glucose, 2300/ul nuclear cells with abnormal cytology. He was admitted to 14D ward on 2014/02/16 for staging. Chest CT on 2014/02/17 revealed a 3cm ill-defined hypodense lesion within collapsed LLL (SE7 IM42), suspected to be primary lung tumor, but no abnormal lymph node was noted. Brain CT on 2014/02/17 showed no evidence of brain or skull metastasis. Whole body bone scan on 2014/02/20 showed no abnormal skeletal uptake. Sonography-guided pleura biopsy (which was limited by inadequate tissue) and bronchoscopic biopsy (in which radial EBUS to LB8 showed concentric peribronchial lesion with pathology reported as chronic inflammation) were performed. He took Tarceva from 2014/02/20 to 2015/02/12 based on mutation testing result (positive for EGFR exon 19 in frame deletion) in specimen taken at 仁愛醫院. The side effect of Tarceva include: acneiform rashses on face, hair loss and grade 2 diarrhea. He was followed up regularly at our out patient clinic and the chest CT during 2014/05/17~2014/11/10 showed stable disease. 
    Since 2015/01, cough, shortness of breath, and left chest pain were noted during exercise. Thoracocentesis was done on 2015/02/16 for EGFR gene result. EGFR study showed exon 19 deletion + exon 20 T790M mutation. CT on 2015/02/09 showed left lung cancer with pleural seeding, more prominent, and mediastinal and left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. For disease progression, he was suggested to enroll the clinical trial of EGF816. He was admitted to oncology ward 4W2 on 2015/03/03 for lung CT guided biopsy and then enrolled into EGF816 trial. 
    He took EGF816-CEGF816X2101 225mg po QD from 2015/03/10 to 2015/12/16 (C1D1~C10D15). Follow-up CT on 2015/12/14 revealed disease progression with bilateral axilla lymphadenopathy and larger bilateral lung metastases. He then admitted to 8B ward on 2015/12/18 and left axillary lymph node excisional biopsy was done on 2015/12/19. The gene analysis showed exon 19 deletion without T790M, Met FISH (-). He was suggested to enroll the clinical trial of TATTON trial. The Brain-Chest-Abdomen CT was done on 2016/01/11, which showed multiple brain metastases (＜=1cm, in bilateral cerebrum and cerebellum), slightly larger bilateral lung metastases, stationary bone and pleural metastasis. TATTON trial with arm of AZD9291 + AZD6244 (omisertinib 80mg 1# QD; selumetinib 75mg 1# Q12H, 4days on-3days off, C1D1=2016/01/22, C2D1=2016/02/19, C3D1=2016/03/18, C4D1=2016/04/15, C5D1=2016/05/13). 
    Follow-up chest CT on 2016/05/20 revealed the lung and chest wall metastases were larger in size. Port-A implantation was done on 2016/06/21 and Alimta + Cisplatin (C1D1=2016/06/10, C2D1=2016/06/30, C3D1=2016/07/21, C4D1=2016/08/11) was given. Brain + chest CT on 2016/08/25 showed the lung and chest wall metastases were larger in size and suspected metastasis in left frontal lobe. Taxotere (C1D1=2016/09/01) was then given. However, brain MRI on 2016/09/12 found multiple brain metastases and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The next out patient clinic was scheduled on 2016/09/22.
    This time, conscious change with seizure was noted on 2016/09/16. His cousin visited him around noon and everythings seemed fine. However, his family were unable to reach him in the afternoon. They went to his house around 20:00 and found him lying on the ground consciouslessly with general clonic tonic seizure, urine incontinence, and a contusion wound on his forehead. He was then sent to the emergency department of 仁愛 hospital. No seizure movement was noted there but he was still with poor conscious (E4V1M4). Brain CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage. Naloxone was given for suspecting opoid overdose (he was using Fentanyl patch 175 mcg at baseline), but the effect was limited. He was then transferred to our emergency department on 2016/09/17.
    At our emergency room, initial vital signs showed high fever with tachypnia (temperature: 38.8 degrees Celcius, heart rate: 66 beats/minute, respiratory rate: 22 times/minute, blood pressure: 112/64 mmHg, saturation: 100% in ambient air). Poor consciousness was still noted (GCS: E2V2M4). Lab data showed no leukocytosis (WBC: 8.75 K/μL, Seg: 80.3%), normocytic anemia (Hb: 9.9 g/dL, MCV: 83.7 fL), thrombocytopenia (PLT: 326 K/μL), hyponatremia (Na+: 129 mmol/L), hypokalemia (K+: 3.4 mmol/L), and hypomagnesemia (Mg2+: 0.57 mmol/L). No pyuria was found. Chest radiography found increased infiltration(s) and suspected nodules in the right lung, nearly total opacification of the left lung, scoliosis of the thoracic spine, and destructive left rib lesions. Brain + chest + abdominal + pelvic computed tomography showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, leptomeningeal process with suspect brain metastasis, left lung cancer with lung, pleural and bone metastases. However, gradually desaturation and dyapnea were noted. Endotrachial tube was then inserted.
    Under the impression of consciousness change and hypoxemic respiratory failure, he was admitted to MICU on 2016/09/17 for etiology survey.

影像報告(Imaging Report) 
CT With/Without Contrast- 2016/09/17 18:57 CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis without and with contrast enhancement shows: 
> Multiple bilateral lung nodules of varying sizes, suggestive of metastases.
> Total consolidation and collapse of the left lung. Left pleural thickening with large loculated pleural effusion.
> Multiple bone metastasis at the spine, sternum, pelvic bones and the left lower rib.
> Small left axillary lymph nodes. 
> A small hypodense splenic lesion.
> Unremarkable liver, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenals. 
> Small paraaortic lymphadenopathy. 
> No definite ileus. Normal appendix.
> No ascites. 
> No definite pulmonary embolism.
