Brief Summary of this week
After admission, the Glasgow Coma Scale was E1M1Vt. No brainstem reflex was
noted. Empirical antibiotics with Tazocin (8/17~8/21) was given.
Hypothermia was performed (8/17~8/19). Intermittent hypotension was noted
and under norepinephrine control. Day 3 electroencephalography was done on
8/21 and it showed severe diffuse cortical dysfunction with more emphasis
on the right side. New onset fever was noted on 8/21 and we re-to septic
wor-up. Tazocin was shifted to cefepime (8/22~). Day 7
electroencephalography was done on 8/25 and it revealed no discernible
cortical activities. Family meeting was arranged on 8/28 and families
decided active withdrawal.

Plan
1. Keep cefepime
2. Monitor body temperature and hemodynamic status
3. Informed family the poor prognosis and discussed with family, ther
refused tracheostomy, after family meeting. they decided withdrawal
4. KCl 40 mEq for K 3.1
