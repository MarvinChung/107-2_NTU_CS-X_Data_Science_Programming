was sent to our ER for felp. The total chest compression time was 13+16=29
minutes. Return of spontaneous circulation was noted after compression. The
lab revealed leukocytosis with left shift and lactate acidosis. Urine
analysis showed pyuria and bacteriuria. Chest X-ray showed bilateral
increased infiltration and post resuscitation change. Brain CT showed mild
brain atrophy, diffusely decreased gray whtie matter differentiation,
possibly hypoxic ischemic change related. Under uroseptic shock with
cardiac arrest, she was admitted to 1A1 for hypothermia therapy.
