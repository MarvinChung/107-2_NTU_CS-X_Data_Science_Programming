25 y/o female
History
MDS, RA type, s/p allogeneic SCT on 2014/01/15, with GVHD presented with
progressive respiratory distress after dicahrged from NTUH on 2015/02/17.
She was BiPAP-dependent upon last discharge, and the latest CT result
showed possible GVHD-related lung changes with bronchiectasis.
Lung function test was performed on 2015/02/13, which disclosed FEV1 18%
and FVC 40%.
After discharge, progressive respiratory distress was told at home with no
improvement even after level titrated to PIP 22/PEEP 4; O2 5L/min, and she
was taken to NTUH ER for help. Upon the arrival, she presented with low-
grade fever to 37.8C with shortness of breath. Septic workup was done.
Initial blood gas showed respiratory acidosis with evident CO2
retention(pCO2 91.2).
Lab data showed leukocytosis(WBC:16.35K) with left shift, and the lactic
acid level was 0.6 initially.
Urinalysis showed pyuria(WBC 75~100) with bacteriuria +.
CXR showed no evident patchy lesion, but increased hilar infiltration was
seen.
However, the respiratory condition worsened rapidly, and intubation was
done in ER(6.5Fr ETT, fixed at 22cm).

Respiration
acute on top of chronic respiratory failure
not sure whether regular use of BiPAP at home or not
now ETT with mechanical ventilator support
limited CO2 retension improvement after intubation
prominant airleak under 6.5 ETT
should change to 7.0
As chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis, suspect bronchiolitis
obliterans
Add inhaled corticosteroid and macrolides
closely monitor breathing condition

Infection
Mepem continue usage

Hematology oncology
the female seems to have limited understanding of her disease and lung
function condition
