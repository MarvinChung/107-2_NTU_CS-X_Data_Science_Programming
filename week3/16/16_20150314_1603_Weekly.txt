9.  Allopurinol allergy (HLA-B*5801 positive)

Treatment 3/2-3/7
    Rasitol pump was administered due to minimal urine output and
progressive pulmonary edmeao on CXR. Deteriorated renal function was also
noted so we consulted nephrologist for  hemodialysis on 3/4, 3/5, 3/6, then
QW135 with titration. NG coffee ground and intermittent bradycardia were
note on 3/3. We gave IV PPI and NPO first. Follow up cardiac enzymes was
CK/MB/TnI:224/21/1.19 and ECG showed no dynamic changes.      Although
NSTEMI was likely but DAPT and heparinization was held due to active
bleeding. We contact CV林俊立 and pacemaker service and rate
adjustment(40/130->70/110ppm) was done.
    New breakthrough fever occurred on 3/4 so Cefepime was upgraded to
Meropenam + Fluconazole. Followed CXR disclosed imroved pulmonary edema.
Liver function showed persistent elevated total bilirubin with low AFP < 2,
representing poor liver regeneration and outcome.

Treatment 3/9-3/14
    Follow up HBV viral load decreased, 3840 cp/ml.
Hospice meeting was arranged and  the family agreed  with with
1.hemodialysis withdrawl now
2.Wish extubation on 3/14
3.CV: CRT-D cannot be closed before pateint expired
    Bilirubin level increased progressively. We extubated the patient on
3/14 PM after all the agreement of his family.
