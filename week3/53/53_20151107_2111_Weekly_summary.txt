[Diagnosis]
1. Coronary artery disease, 3-vessel-disease, with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, status post ECMO support, status post percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty with stenting to right coronary artery and percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty to left circumflex artery (2015/10/30)
2. Seizure, suspect hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and hypoperfusion related
3. LV thrombus
4. Diabetes mellitus (2015/10/26, HbA1c: 7.7)
5. Dyslipidemia
6. Nephrotic syndrome, etiology to be determined
7. UGI bleeding

dopamine 8.02/kg/min(0.802mcg/Kg/min X 10ml/hr)
Levophed 0.016/Kg/min(0.016mcg/Kg/min X 1ml/hr)
ECMO flow: 2.0L/min, FiO2: 80%
IABP support:1:1

[Treatment course of this week]
We kept tapering inotropic agent. CAG was done with ECMO and IABP suppport on 2015/11/5. However, POBAS failed due to difficult approach. Lung edema was noted after CAG and we kept CAVH.
