[Diagnosis]
1. Coronary artery disease, 3-vessel-disease, with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, status post ECMO support, status post percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty with stenting to right coronary artery and percutaneous occlusive balloon angioplasty to left circumflex artery (2015/10/30)
2. Seizure, suspect hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and hypoperfusion related
3. LV thrombus
4. Diabetes mellitus (2015/10/26, HbA1c: 7.7)
5. Dyslipidemia
6. Nephrotic syndrome, etiology to be determined
7. UGI bleeding

dopamine 9.624/kg/min(0.802mcg/Kg/min X 12ml/hr)
Levophed off from 11/10 night
ECMO flow: 2.0L/min, FiO2: 60%
IABP support:1:1

[Current Mv setting]
PCV IP 16, RR: 10, PEEP: 6, FiO2: 40%
--> VT: 370, rate:11,  SpO2: 100%

[Treatment course of this week]
We kept CAVH for fluid overload. His weight decreased nearly 10Kg in a week. His CVP was relatively low and systemic BP got lower. Low intravascular volume was favored. We added coloid support and continued weaning ECMO.
