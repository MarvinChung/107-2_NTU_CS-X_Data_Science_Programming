Brief Summary of this week 
We added Cubicin under the consider of CRBSI(IABP B/C:VSE)CAG was done on 2015/11/18 again. POBAS to LM-LCx was done. However, inotropic agent and ECMO flow increased due to worsened hemodynamic status. Fever took place on 2015/11/19 with AFRVR. We switched antibiotics to Cubicin+Mepem+Eraxis after discussion with VS莊祐中. B/C yielded VSE again and IABP infection was impressed. We began tapering IABP after discussion with VS紀乃新 from 2015/11/21.

PAP1
Assessment 
dopamine 17.7mcg/kg/min
epinephrine 10.6 mcg/min
ECMO flow: 2.5L/min, FiO2: 100%
IABP support:1:2

AfRVR with aberrant conduction --> rate improved under amiodarone infusion, but still not reverted to sinus
Hemodynamics improved

[Current Mv setting]
PCV IP 16, RR: 10, PEEP: 8, FiO2: 60%
--> VT: 340, rate: 17, Mv: 3.9, SpO2: 97%

[Antibiotics course]
Cubicin:11/15-
Mepem 11/19-
Anidulafungin:11/19-

Diflucan:11/19
Cravit 11/19
Ceftazidime:10/31-11/8, 11/15-11/19
Vancomycin:10/31-11/14
Mepem:11/8-11/15
Ceftriaxone:10/29-10/31

[Physical examination]
Pupil 2/2mm, LR +/+
MP at least 3+ symmetrically
HEENT: conjunctiva: not pale
Chest: no wheezing, diffuse crackles
Heart: IRHB (HR~80-110)
Abdomen: mild distened, normoactive bowel sound
Extremities: skin turgor: dry

Plan
1. Keep heparinization for LV thrombus/IABP/ECMO, continue clopidogrel. Monitor for bleeding (hematuria + hematemesis). Add aspirin if bleeding improves 
2. Amidarone for A-fib RVR with aberrant conduction
3. Keep Cubicin, Mepem, anidulafungin for new spesis and CRBSI
4. On CAVH, titrate UF for lung congestion if shock stablized. monitor BP+HR, CVC goal 10-12
5. Remove IABP ASAP if BP tolerable
6. Inform family about critical condition, the patient favor DNR if new sepsis with profound shock
7. Consult CVS for MICS CABG if infection improve.
