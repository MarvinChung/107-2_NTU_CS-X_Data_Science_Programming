Brief Summary of this week
Ecchymosis on right abdomen was noted on 12/1. Lab data on 12/2 showed
hypofibrinogenemia(134.5), so Cryoprecipitate 10U was transfused on 12/2
and 12/3. The ecchymosis became fainter in the following days. Left chest
and breast pain was noted on 12/3. The skin appearance was normal. The pain
improved spontaneously next day. Hemogram on 12/4 showed WBC 5.37k with
blast account for 24%. We informed her husband poor prognosis, and
discussed future treatment with him. Asymptomatic hypotension(SBP below 90)
was noted intermittently, so we added cortisone for potential adrenal
insufficiency on 12/4 based on long term steroid exposure history.
