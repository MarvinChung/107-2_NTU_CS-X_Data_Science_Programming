Brief Summary of this week
Profound shock requiring ceiling dose of Levophed+ Pitressin+ Epinephrine
was found upon admission to 3A2. Central catheter was replaced as blood
culture from previous CVC yielded GNB, which final report yielded resistant
strain E.Coli. Stress dose Solu-cortef (50mg BID) was administered. GCS-f
was given due to neutropenic fever while chemotherapy (BOMES) was
suspended. Mepem was continued and Vorinocazole was added as  aspergillus
antigen showed elevated titer of 5.018. Pre-emptive Ganciclovir was given
to cover CMV viremia (CMV viral load 3080). Sputum specimen was tested
positive for PJP by RT-PCR hence Sevatrim was administered. Since 12/25
morning, limb tonic twitching with rightward gaze and post-ictal paralysis
was noted. Immediate brain CT for concern of ICH was unremarkable.
Metabolic factors were corrected but intermittent convulsion was still
noted. Brain CT with contrast and awake EEG were arranged as neurologist
suggested. CT with contrast did not showed acute intracranial pathology.
Keppra was first added, and subsequent use of continuous Anxicam infusion
due to poorly controlled seizure. An episode of hypotension developed
following Phenytoin loading.

Assessment
Mepem (12/24-) D5 for resistant E.Coli bacteremia
Voriconazole(12/25-) D4 for suspected aspergillosis
Sevatrium(12/25-) D4 for PJP pneumonia
Ganciclovir(12/25-) D4 for CMV viremia

ABP 90/62 HR 116 under Levophed 8.533mcg/min
Anxicam 1mL/hr for suspected status epilepticus
Urine amount 390mL/16hr
Pronounced weight gain 59-> 77kg in one week
Defervescence after steroid/ ice cooling blanket
Intermittent right side (facial and limb) convulsion
Tachypnea, low tidal volume, worsened oxygenation

<Physical finding>
GCS E2M5Vt, drowy, follow command(-)
HEENT: short neck, grade 1 goiter, anicterus, isocoric pupil
             bilateral swelling as before, no erythematous change
             one palpable mass, movable, elastic at left level V
Breathing: coarse crackles at basal lung, diminished over left basal
Heart: rapid and regular, no audible murmur
Abdomen: round and distended, hypoactive bowel sound, no gaurding
Extremity: scattered ecchymosis at lower extremity, no peripheral edema

[Treatment course]
12/25 Seizure was noted 5 times within 30 sec since morning
       4 limbs tonic twiching with right ward gaze. Post ictal paralysis+
       K 3.0 s/p 60mEq, Ca 1.8, Mg 0.76 s/p 32mEq,  ammonia 36
       Even after electrolyte suppliment
       Pupil symmetric to light reflex. trace, 2mm.
       Brain CT: no obcious ICH or midline shift
       2014/2 CSF cytology: no blast.
  => suspected sepsis related, r/o electrolyte imbalance, r/o CNS invol
  => consult neurologist for further evaluation and AED use.
12/26 intermittent seizure, GTC or right partial frequent but self-limited
for about seconds
         EEG: pending
  Brain CT with contrast as neurologist suggestion: Mild leukoaraiosis
  Neurologist: Keppra for tm. Suggest MRI (but no suitable due to
                       levophed use). Suggest CSF study.
  Hema 陳尹愷: Transfuse PLT 24U daily. If PLT>50K on W1, do CSF study.
  ID: DC Daptomycin. Stop Cravit due to E.coli bacteremia, MIC resistent.
  Due to severe sepsis, choose broad spectrum Abx: Mepem and
  Maxipime were both has <1% risk of seizure. Tazocin is not suitable
  due to Aspergillosis false positive risk. Cravit resistent to E.coli.
  --> Keep Mepem

12/27 still frequent GTC under Anxicam PRN and keppra use: 4-5times/8hrs
      intermittent low TV and apnea, right hand grasping and mouth chewing,
no response to calling --> seizure?
      pupil 2.5+/2.5+,
      four limbs to pain(RUL/LUL/RLL/LLL)= 3/3-/2/2 (as before)
      low TV improved after Anxicam 2mg-> poor effect
        --> 6mg STAT, then cIF 4mg
      --> Discussed with neurologist, due to frequent GTC under Anxicam and
keppra, suggest phenytoin for faster control. He could not sure whether
intermittent low TV is related to seizure or not. Also, every iv form AED
may has risk of SJS, possible but low.
       Recheck loading dose with pharmacist: 15-20mg/kg, max 1000mg
12/28 Bedside echo: left side pleural effusion, moderate amount


Plan
1. Mepem for resistant E.coli bacteremia, voriconazole for suspected
invasive aspergillosis, Sevatrim for PJP pneumonia and Ganciclovir for CMV
viremia. F/U Aspergillus Ag and CMV viral assay QW
2. Stress dose solu-cortef 50mg Q12H, glycemic control
3. GCSF 300mcg BID for neutropenic fever with septic shock
4. Component therapy with PKT transfusion to  keep PLT >50K on W1 for
lumbar puncture. Check HLA for platelet refractoriness
5. NPO for GI bleeding and typhlitis, aminofluid supplement and bowel
stimulation with Primperan
6. Nexium 40mg Q12H for suspected duodenal ulcer bleeding
7. AED: Keppra 1000mg Q12H, Anxicam pump run 1mL/hr for suspected status
epilepticus
    Consider brain MRI when the condition stablizes.
    Pursue EEG report
