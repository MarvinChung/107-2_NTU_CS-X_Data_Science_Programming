Brief Summary of this week
Nystatin was prescribed for oral thrush, which resolved 2 days later. Oral
swab culture yielded Candida albicans. Blood data on 12/16 showed
hypokalemia(1.8mmol/L) and hypomagnesemia(0.62mmol/L). VBG showed metabolic
alkalosis. CBC showed leukemia progression(WBC 21.49k/μL, Blast 19？000
0000 Plt 23k/μL). Potassium 100mEq and magnesium 24mEq were administered,
after which both potassium and magnedium level improved(K 3.4mmol/L, Mg
1.18  mmol/L). Platelet 12U was transfused for thrombocytopenia on 12/16.
Fever up to 38.3 developed right after transfusion, so diphenhydramine and
Solu-Cortef were administered. Fever was noted again on 12/17, so oral
Cravit was changed to Tazocin. Urinalysis revealed clear urine. CXR showed
suspected bilateral pleural effusion. Blood data on 12/18 showed leukemia
further progression(WBC 61.94k/μL, Blast 80？000 0000 Plt 20k/μL) and
hypophosphatemia(1mg/dL), so Joulie solution at her own cost and platelet
12U was administered. CBC on 12/19 showed severe leukocytosis(WBC
113.45K/μL). Afetr discussion with her husband, we administered BOMES on
12/19. Since there was no definite infection, and the fever might be tumor
fever, we changed Tazocin to oral Cravit; meanwhile, Diflucan was
prescribed for prolonged FN.
