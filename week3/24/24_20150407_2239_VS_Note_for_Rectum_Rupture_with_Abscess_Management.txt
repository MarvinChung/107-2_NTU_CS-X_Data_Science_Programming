Event: The patient was found rectum rupture with abscess s/p CT-guided
drainage. Radiologist informed high mortality risk and suggested to consult
CRS man for colostomy or further surgery. The consulted CRS man had family
meeting with family on 4/07 night. This old aged patient had high risk to
tolerate surgery. Therefore, NPO, nutrition support and drainage of the
abscess should be the best policy. The radiologist would like to change the
bigger tube to drain the abscess (stool-like material) a few days later.
