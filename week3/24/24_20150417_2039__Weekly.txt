Brief Summary of this week
After admission, Albumin by co-paid with diuretics were empirically used
for anasarca. Neurologist was consulted for titration of medicaiton dosage
for Parkinsonism. No more bloody stools was noted and NG feeding with
Ensure 1250kcal/day was given smoothly. Family meeting was arranged to
discuss about the patient's treatment planning , prognosis then DNR permit
was signed by her family. Dietitian was consulted for feeding diet
adjustment. However, new onset of fever was noted and after septic workup,
we kept Tienam and loading once dose of Vancomycin 750mg. Chest tapping was
done for suspect parapneumonic effusion on 3/30.  Meanwhile, atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noted. Hence, Cordarone
infusion was given on 3/30. The pathologist informed atypical cells were
found from pleural fluid cytology. Malignancy cannot be excluded. Another
episode of fever was found on 3/31 then Anegyn was added to cover intra-
abdominal infection.Whole body CT data revealed 1.Motion artifacts. Old
insults, severe leukoaraiosis, and brain atrophy.2.suspected sigmoid
diverticulitis with abscess formation in left pelvic cavity. 3. prominent
consolidation of RLL. prominent increased right pleural effusion.Due to
persist high fever,Maxipime was shift to Mepem on 4/5 for infection
control.
 For pleural effusion,right pig-tail was inserted on 4/5 and drainage 500ml
QD if condition stable .Radiologist was consulted for uspected sigmoid
diverticulitis with abscess formation in left pelvic cavity.PTCD was
inserted for intra-abdominal abcess drainaged.Surgical intervention was
suggested and we consult GS for evaluated on 4/7.
However,after family meeting and well explained the mothods (stoma
creation, bowel resection....) and indications (failure to medication and
pigtail drainage) of surgical treatment. Due to her complicated situation
and old age, supportive care (abx treatment and pigtail drainage, NPO) was
suggested.NPO with TPN nutrition support since 4/7 and she kept
hospitalized for conservative treatment.Abdominal Pig-tail replacement on
4/11 for dysfunction by Radiologist.Fever and muscle tremor were persist
suspected related to intra-abdominal abscess.We consulted Infection man
again and given cubicin and colimycin since 4/15.However,spetic shock was
noted since 4/15 and poor response to colloid and blood component.There
fore the vasopresors, and inotropics were given to mantait blood pressure
but her general condition still downhill.No urine output was noted since
4/16 and we started taper fluid for edema.No adverse drug reaction was
noted throughout the hospitalization course.

Plan
1.Keep on CVP care. DC TPN改D50W 500ml QD避免水腫加重.
2.Contact with radiologist Dr.劉高郎 to change a bigger tube to drain the
abscess and stool-like material scheduled on 4/13(W1), done. -> Discuss
pigtail revision but not suggested by radiologist.
3.Keep on NPO and give IV medications as needed.
4.Keep on Transamin 1 amp ivp q8h.
5.Mepem D11 + Tygacil D3 -> Colistin [D2] and Daptomycin [D2] for VRE/mDRKP
due to breakthrough fever on 4/15.
6.Seizure control with IV Anxecam + Keppra
[家屬拒絕打抗癲癇針,怕病人更會一直睡!]
7.DNR同意書(除呼吸器與藥物外). 病人兒子希望能夠在母親最後的時候助念12小時,
若安排留一口氣回家給予相關說明協助.
8.Check WBC (8290), CRP(3.03) on 4/13 -> Fever on 4/14 ->
WBC(12950),Hb(8.2), Cre(0.5), lactic acid(1.19) on 4/14
11.Explain to son and daughter. Vasopressor may cause limb ischemia. If
limb ischemia不再增加升壓劑, 家屬決定改為院宣.
12.Anuria -> DC unnecessary IV medicine.
13.Give Morphine SC Q6H for tachypnea -> consult hospice for suggestion.
