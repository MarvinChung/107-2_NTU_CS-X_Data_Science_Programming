Brief Summary of this week
After admission, we kept Tienam for pneumonia and suspect intra-abdominal
infection. Intermittent bilateral hands tremor was noted and we consulted
neurologist for Parkinson’s disease adjustment. Followed chest x-ray image
showed right side pleural effusion. Peak fever was noted on 3/28 and blood
culture was followed. Thoracocentesis was done on 3/30 for right side
pleural effusion, 750 light straw color pleural effusion was drainage and
data showed transudate. But desaturation was noted on 3/30 evening and
subsided after oxygen demand up to 8L/min. Cordarone  was prescribed for
tachycardia. Desaturation again was happened on 3/31 and subsided after
Ambu-bagging. Fever was noted and we added Anegyn for suspect intra-
abdominal infection. We shifted antibiotic Vancomycin and Maxipime for
better coverage. Infection was consulted, incomplete treated diverticulitis
with persisting intra-abdominal infection was suspect, check stool
Clostridium difficile toxin A+B and arrange CT and coloscopy was suggested.
Clostridium difficile toxin A+B showed positive and stool showed mushy and
brow color, we kept Anegyn use. Chest, abdominal and pelvic CT was done on
4/2 and image showed prominent consolidation of RLL, prominent increased
right pleural effusion, suspected sigmoid diverticulitis with abscess
formation in left pelvic cavity was reported. However, clonic movement of
bilateral shoulder more severe was noted on 4/2 morning. Oral EEG report
showed bilateral temporal seizure like episode. Neurologist was consulted,
epileptogenicity noted on EEG and tremors, favor enhanced parkinsonian
tremor under metabolic dysregulation was suspected. Neurologist suggested
keep Keppra, pursuit formal EEG report, follow EEG next week, correct
metabolic factors, follow ammonia and lactate, arrange brain CT and monitor
her consciousness was suggested. We will close monitor her clinical
condition. No obvious adverse drug reaction was noted throughout the
hospitalization course.
Treatment goals:
Infection control (body temperature < 38 degree)

2015/04/02 CT With/Without Contrast-Chest (V1)
Chest CT without and with contrast enhancement shows: in compare to
previous similar study 20130905. 1. s/p tracheostomy with airway insertion,
stationary. 2. prominent subpleural consolidation of RLL & minimal at LLL.
Fibrotic and emphysematous changes of both lungs. 3. prominent right
pleural effusion. Bilateral apical pleural thickening, more on left. 4.
Small lymph nodes in the mediastinum. 5. Atherosclerotic changes of the
aorta. 6. Severe kyphosis and scoliosis. Multiple compression fractures of
the thoracic and lumbar spine. 7. Right renal cyst. 8. Placement of a
nasogastric tube. 9. calcification of the coronary arteries, indicates CAD.
calcification on the aortic valve, AS maybe considered. calcification on
the mitral annulus/valve noted, suggest follow up & correlated with
clinical manifestation. Please refer to detailed report and CT imaging of
other body part(s).
prominent consolidation of RLL. prominent increased right pleural effusion.

Plan
1.Keep Tienam (3/23-4/1) to Cefepime (4/1-) and keep Metronidazole (3/31-)
and Vancomycin (4/1-) for persistent fever and sputum gram stain GPC in
cluster 3+ noted on 3/22 and possible enterococcus infection due to
diverticulitis with abscess not complete treatment since 2015/2
2.Keep Keppra use (4/2-)
3.Keep Cordarone 1# bid since 4/01
4.Give NG feeding bag for suspected GERD and suggest to sit up as feeding
and usual care (於4/1抽痰發現有黃綠色液體, 疑似為胃腸液的表現; 目前使用
feeding bag後沒有在看到有黃綠色液體從氣切管抽出)
5.Keep Nexium.[病人兒子拒絕做胃鏡]
6.Keep on Madopar(250) 0.5 # tid for Parkinsonism.
7.Pursue sputum culture (3/31) and blood culture (3/31)
8.Arrange aspiration for intraabdominal abscess if the family agreed
9.Arrange thoracocentesis if indicated and her family agreed
