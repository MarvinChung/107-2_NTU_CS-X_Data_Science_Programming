66 M with:
1. Atrial fibrillation (previous apixaban)
2. Hypertension
3. DM
4. Graves disease, hyperthyroidism

Tx: After emergent surgery on 7/8, consciousness level remained M4E1Vt.
Revision of EVD was performed on 7/12 due to follow-up CT revealed
increased hydrocephalus. Severe bradycardia and long pause was noted after
surgery. TCP was used temporaily. Antibiotic was shifted to vanco and
flumarin empirically due to persistent fever. Family meeting was arranged.
Pending family's decision of whether tracheostomy/TPM and long-term care or
weaning/hospice.

P: Acute impaired verbal expression and comprehension and right side
weakness

A:
7/8 diffuse SAH, left MCA aneurysm ruptured, s/p Left fronto-temporal
craniotomy pterional approach for aneurysm clipping and EVD implantation.

**GCS: E1M4VT /Pupil: 3/3(+,+)/Diet:NG

7/11 Brain CT showed left temporofrontal progressive brain edema, suspect
ICH induced
7/12 CT: hydro progressed, suspect mal function of EVD
     OP replacement of EVD --> AfRVR, s/p IV herbessor + trandate --> AfSVR
was noted, on TCP OBS(no DC shock)
7/13 We contact CV VS.林亮宇: No need for Rytmoron currently
     Recurrent tachycardia at night
     12-lead EKG:AFL
     Add oral herbessor --> AfSVR was noted, on TCP OBS(no DC shock)
7/14 NE stationary, HTN-> + perdipine
     --> recurrent AfRVR
     --> reflex tachycardia?
7/15 Add Rytmonorm and Concor
     --> Sinus rythm
7/16 d/c concor, ICP 5-6, Lumbar: 20ml Q8H, EVD <10ml
7/17 Stationary GCS and NE. Sinus rythm.
7/19 perfusion CT: no significant vasospasm, but still brain swelling and
midline shift
7/21 Remove lumbar drain
     GCS:E1M4VT, MP:Rt:3/3, Lt:2/2
7/22 long pause in the morning, s/p TCP pacing. k and Mg supp.
7/23 Persistent SSS
7/24 stationary NE, family meeting is arranged today
7/25 No answer after family meeting


P: 1. Keep SBP:140~180
   2. Keep CCP>60
   3. Close monitor NE
   4. keep mannitol Q8H
   5. HHH, voluven 500ml Q12H
   6. Electrolyte supplement
