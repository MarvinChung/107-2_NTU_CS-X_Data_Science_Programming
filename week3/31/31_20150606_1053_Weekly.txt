Brief Summary of this week
After admission, DAPT with heparization was kept. Comatous consciousness
was found during admission, and hypothermia therapy was initiated. ACS was
less likely, so heparin was discontinued. Dopamine was used for hypotension
shortly. The patient remained comatous but spontaneous trigger of breath
was noted. We shifted diuretics to rasitol pump since 5/28 for oligouria
and informed the family about risk of H/D. The urine output was adequate.
EEG was performed on 5/29 and showed isoelectric tracing, suggesting
hypoxic encephalopathy. We repeat EEG again on 6/1 which also showed
isoelectric tracing. After discussion, they signed DNR, refused
hemodialysis and agreed to withdraw life support. Followed blood culture
was negative and antibiotic was discontinued after 5 days treatment for
pneumonia. We started weaning with pressure support ventilation and he
passed T-piece trial on 6/5. He was extubated on 6/6 and mask was applied.

Assessment
ABx: Nil
     s/p Mepem (6/2~6/6), Tazocin (5/26-6/2)

<P.E>
E1M1Vt, pupil: 4mm/ 3mm, Light reflex: L/R: -/-
Chest: bil corase BS, no wheezings
Heart: RHB, no murmurs

<study>
5/26 Echo: EF 69.4, no RWMA, impaired LV relaxation.
5/26 brain CT: diffuse brain edema
5/26 CAG: LM; patent, LAD: diffuse up to 90% stenosis, LCX: diffuse disease
up to 95 % stenosis, RCA: proximal 90% stenosis, mid total occlusion
LIMA: patent
SVG-PDA-PLA: patent
SVG-RI: patent
5/29 EEG: isoeletric tracing
5/31 S/C: few stenotrophomonas, stool culture(-), urine culture(-)
6/1 EEG: This EEG reveals no discernible cortical activities
6/2 Procalcitonin 3.872, severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis -> shift
antibiotic to mepem for better coverage of ESBL pathogens
6/6 Extubation in the afternoon

<Consultation>
Neurologist:
Severe cortical dysfunction with no discernible cortical activity on
electroencephalography
For preserved autonomic drive in terms of respiration and circulation,
persistent vegetative state should be considered after withdraw of
supportive treatments.

<Important decision>
6/2 His son confirmed no hemodialysis, for HIE, they still needed some time
to discuss about withdrawl or not
6/3 DNR signed (不電不壓拔管不重插)
6/4 Family decided withdrawl on 6/6

Plan
1. Supportive care and extubation today after family visit
2. Split dose insulin for sugar control
3. Keep hospice combine care
