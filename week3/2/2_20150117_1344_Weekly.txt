Brief Summary of this week
During this week, the patient's condition was stable. Still occasional
focal seizure attack over right shoulder. The patient and family decided to
receive tracheostomy. We had consulted chest surgeon and tracheostomy was
performed on 2015/01/14. The post-operative course was smooth. We will keep
supportive care and tracheostomy care.
