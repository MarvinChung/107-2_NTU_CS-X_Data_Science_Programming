Brief Summary of this week
During this week, the patient's condition was stable. Several times of
focal seizure attack at right shoulder was noted, which subsided
spontaneously. Diarrhea was also noted and improved after antidiarrheal
agent use. We had consulted social worker for financial support. Now the
patient and family are considering about receiving tracheostomy operation.
We will contact chest surgeon if they decided to receive tracheostomy.
