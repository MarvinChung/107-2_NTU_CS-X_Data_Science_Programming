Brief Summary of this week
After admission, empirical antibiotic Rocephin were prescribed but shifted
to Tazocin due to fever. Also blood culture yielded one set of MRcons,
Targocid was transiently prescribed due to fever initially. Antibiotic was
changed to Tatumcef for sputum culture yieldedSphingomonas paucimobilis.
  On 1/12 hemodialysis was started for anuria with fluid overload. There
were poor neurologic response and no spontaneous respiration. Also poor
lung compliance was noted.
EEG was arranged on 1/15 and revealed no discernible cortical activities,
compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy. Withdrawl life support will be
discussed with family.

Assessment
S/P CPCR with ROSC, day+9
Rocephin (1/9~10)
Tazocin 1/10~1/15
Targocid 1/11~1/17
Tatumcef 1/15~

E1VtM1, without pupil light refelx, (4mm/4mm)

Ventilator: PC/AV --> VC, Vt: 300ml, PEEP 6, FiO2 50%, RR 20
=> MV ~5 SpO2: 95-100%

2015/01/15 腦波檢查報告
EEG diagnosis: Abnormal EEG; isoeletric tracing
EEG interpretation: This EEG reveals no discernible cortical activities.
These findings are compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy.

Hold hemodialysis and levophed for withdrawl

[Important family decision]
DNR (不電不壓)
女兒表示, 若腦波結果不好, 同意在給予適當鎮定止痛藥下,
以減量呼吸器的方式撤除維生設備

[Treatment course]
1/17 1/17 DC Targocid due to another blood culture: negative.
     1/15 EEG report: no discernible cortical activities. These findings
are compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy

1/15 Arrange EEG, shift Tazocin to Tatumcef for Sphingomonas paucimobilis
1/14 No spontaneous respiration, poor lung compliance. Informed the
ventilation dependent status. Discuss with the withdrawl symptoms
1/14  night, family asked about further examination, such as EEG, to
support more evidence about brain damage. (they agreed with self-paid EEG)
      FiO2: 60% => 50%, SpO2: 95, no drive to breathe
1/13  FiO2 70% --> 60%,
1/13 night, keep on dialysis
1/12  FiO2 55%--> 70%  Anuria with fluid overload, start hemodialysis
1/11  E1VeM1, Hypoactive bowel sound, bilateral lung wheezing
keep on Tazocin use for coverage of nosocomial infection
      high dose of Furosemide for anuria
      Titrate Levophed to 6mcg/min use
      Prepare for dialysis tomorrow if anuria persists
1/10 DNR (不電不壓), PCV: IP: 20, PEEP: 6, FiO2: 50% --> MV: ~11-12, SpO2:
99-100%, decreased urine output

Plan
1. Keep ceftazidime for sputum Sphingomonas paucimobilis.
   Discontinued Targocid for blood culture yielded MR-Staphylococcus
haemolyticus, for another culture result negtive
2. Inform the EEG result to her family, prepare withdrwal life support.
