A: 
He was admitted for treatment of pneumonia. However, bloody stool was noted during the treatment course, work up revealed possible colon cancer. However, tissue proof was refused by families due to his poor general perfomance status and clinical status. Recurrent hospital acquired infection was encountered during admission. Septic shock was noted on 10/27. Levophed and multiple broad-spectrum antibiotic were administered. However, refractory metabolic acidosis and unstable vital signs were still noted. 

We are consluted for hospice combined care.
